A Note About the Author
For no one
Do you remember back in old L.A.
When everybody drove a Chevrolet?
Whatever happened to the boy next door
The suntanned, crew-cut, all-American male?
“Beach Baby”
The First Class
If you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from
yourself.
1984
George Orwell
MANY YEARS AGO I REALIZED THAT A BOOK, a novel, is a dream
that asks itself to be written in the same way we fall in love with someone:
the dream becomes impossible to resist, there’s nothing you can do about it,
you finally give in and succumb even if your instincts tell you to run the other
way because this could be, in the end, a dangerous game—someone will get
hurt. For a few of us the first ideas, images, the initial stirrings can prompt
the writer to automatically immerse themselves in the novel’s world, its
romance and fantasy, its secrets. For others it can take longer to feel this
connection more clearly, ages to realize how much you needed to write the
novel, or love that person, to relive that dream, even decades later. The last
time I thought about this book, this particular dream, and telling this version
of the story—the one you’re reading now, the one you just began—was
almost twenty years ago, when I thought I could handle revealing what
happened to me and a few of my friends at the beginning of our senior year at
Buckley, in 1981. We were teenagers, superficially sophisticated children,
who really knew nothing about how the world actually worked—we had the
experience, I suppose, but we didn’t have the meaning. At least not until
something happened that moved us into a state of exalted understanding.
When I first sat down to write this novel, a year after the events had
taken place, it turned out that I couldn’t deal with revisiting this period, or
any of those people I knew and the terrible things that befell us, including,
most crucially, what had actually happened to me. In fact without even
writing a word I shut the idea of the project down almost as soon as I began it
—I was nineteen. Even without picking up a pen or sitting at my typewriter,
only gently remembering what happened proved too unnerving in that
moment and I was at a place in my life that didn’t need the added stress and I
forced myself to forget about that period, at least for a while, and it wasn’t
hard to erase the past in that moment. But the urge to write the book returned
when I left New York after living there for over twenty years—the East Coast
was where I escaped almost immediately upon graduation, fleeing the trauma
of my last year at high school—and found myself living back in Los Angeles,
where those events from 1981 had taken place, and where I felt stronger,
more resolved about the past, and that I was capable of steeling myself from
the pain of it all and entering the dream. But this turned out not to be the case
then either, and after typing up a few pages of notes about the events that
happened in the autumn of 1981, when I thought I had numbed myself with
half a bottle of Ocho in order to keep proceeding, letting the tequila stabilize
my trembling hands, I experienced an anxiety attack so severe that it sent me
to the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai in the middle of that night. If we want
to connect the act of writing with the metaphor of romance then I had wanted
to love this novel and it seemed to be finally offering itself to me and I was so
tempted, but when it came time to consummate the relationship I found
myself unable to fall into the dream.
—
THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS WRITING specifically about the Trawler
—a serial killer who had been haunting the San Fernando Valley starting in
the late spring of 1980 and then announcing their presence more strongly in
the summer of 1981 and who was frighteningly somehow connected to us—
and a wave of stress so severe crashed over me that night I began making
notes I actually moaned with fear from the memories and I collapsed,
retching up the tequila I’d been gulping down. Xanax I kept in the nightstand
by my bed was no help—I swallowed three and knew they weren’t going to
do anything quickly enough. In that moment: I was sure I was about to die. I
dialed 911 and told the operator I was having a heart attack and then fainted.
The landline I was calling from—this was in 2006, I was forty-two, I lived
alone—alerted them as to where the location was and an alarmed doorman
from the front desk of the high-rise I lived in escorted the EMTs to the
eleventh floor. My apartment was unlocked by the doorman and they found
me on the floor in the bedroom. I regained consciousness in an ambulance as
it sped along San Vicente Boulevard toward Cedars-Sinai, a short distance
from the Doheny Plaza, where I lived, and after I was wheeled into the
emergency room prone on a stretcher and had reoriented myself as to what
had happened, I became embarrassed—the Xanax had kicked in and I was
calm and I knew there was nothing physically wrong with me. I knew the
panic attack was directly related to the memories I had of the Trawler and
more specifically of Robert Mallory.
A doctor checked me out—I was basically fine but the hospital wanted
me to stay the night so they could perform a battery of tests, including
running an MRI, and my primary physician agreed, reminding me over the
phone that my health insurance would cover almost all of the stay. But I
needed to get home and opted out of whatever tests they wanted to administer
because if I had stayed at Cedars that night I was sure I’d slip into madness,
knowing that what happened to me had nothing to do with my body or any
malady I may or may not have harbored. It was a reaction simply connected
to memory, to the past and conjuring that awful year—to Robert Mallory, and
the Trawler, and Matt Kellner and Susan Reynolds and Thom Wright and
Deborah Schaffer, as well as the darkened tunnel I was traveling through at
seventeen.
—
AFTER THAT NIGHT I abandoned the project and instead wrote two other
books during the following thirteen years, and it wasn’t until 2020 that I felt I
could begin The Shards, or The Shards had decided that Bret was ready
because the book was announcing itself to me—and not the other way
around. I hadn’t reached out to the book because I spent so many years
pushing myself away from the dream, from Robert Mallory, from that senior
year at Buckley; so many decades spent pushing away from the Trawler, and
Susan and Thom and Deborah and Ryan, and what happened to Matt Kellner;
I had relegated this story to the dark corner of the closet and for many years
this avoidance worked—I didn’t pay as much attention to the book and it
stopped calling out to me. But sometime during 2019 it began climbing its
way back, pulsing with a life of its own, wanting to merge with me,
expanding into my consciousness in such a persuasive way that I couldn’t
ignore it any longer—trying to ignore it had become a distraction. This
particular timing had coincided with the fact that I wasn’t writing screenplays
anymore, that I had decided at a certain point to stop chasing that game—a
decade of being well compensated for TV pilots and scripts for movies that
would mostly never be made—and I briefly wondered if there was a
connection between the book beckoning to me and the new lack of interest in
writing for Hollywood. It didn’t matter: I had to write the book because I
needed to resolve what happened—it was finally time.
—
THE SPARK FOR MY RENEWED INTEREST in the novel was initiated by
a brief moment years after that anxiety attack landed me in Cedars. I’d seen a
woman—I was going to say a girl, but she wasn’t any longer; she was a
woman in her mid-fifties, my age—on the corner of Holloway and La
Cienega in West Hollywood. She was standing on the sidewalk outside the
Palihouse Hotel, wearing sunglasses, a phone pressed against her ear, waiting
for a car, and even though this was a much older version of the girl I used to
know when we were in high school it was unmistakably her. I knew it even
though I hadn’t seen her in almost forty years: she was still effortlessly
beautiful. I had just made a left turn onto Holloway and was stopped in traffic
when I noticed the figure on the deserted sidewalk beneath the umbrella at
the valet stand—she was maybe twenty feet away from me. Instead of the
happy surprise at seeing an old friend I was frozen with a sheet of dread—it
draped over me immediately and I went ice cold. That glimpse of this woman
in the flesh caused the fear to return and it started swallowing everything—
just like it had in 1981. She was a reminder that it had all been real, that the
dream had actually happened, that even though four decades had passed since
we last saw each other, we were still bound by the events of that fall.
I didn’t suddenly pull over to the side of Holloway, near the mouth of the
garage of the CVS across the street from the Palihouse, and present myself to
the woman, exclaim surprise, get out of the car and offer her an embrace,
marvel at how beautiful she still looked—I had successfully avoided contact
with any of my classmates from our senior year on social media, with only a
few having reached out to me over the years, usually in the weeks after I
published a book. Instead I just stared through the windshield of the BMW I
was driving as she stood on that deserted sidewalk, holding the phone to her
ear, listening to whoever was talking to her, not saying anything, and even
with the sunglasses on, there was something haunted in the way she held
herself, or maybe I was imagining this was true—maybe she was fine, maybe
she had completely adjusted and had processed what happened to her in the
fall of 1981, the terrible injury she suffered, the awful revelation she
experienced, the losses she endured. I was on my way to Palm Springs with
Todd, someone I’d met in 2010 and who’d been living with me for the past
nine years, to spend a week with a friend flying in from New York who had
rented a house on the edges of the movie colony in Palm Springs before
heading to San Diego to attend a series of conferences. I’d been having a
conversation with Todd when I saw the woman in front of the Palihouse and
was shut down mid-sentence. A car suddenly blared its horn behind me and
when I glanced at the rearview mirror I realized the light on Holloway had
turned green and I wasn’t moving. “What’s wrong?” Todd asked as I
accelerated too quickly and lurched toward Santa Monica Boulevard. I
swallowed, and numbly offered, trying to sound utterly neutral: “I knew that
girl…”
—
OF COURSE SHE WASN’T a girl any longer—again, she was almost fiftyfive, as I was—but that was how I’d known her: a girl. It didn’t matter. Todd
just asked, “What girl?” and I made a vague distracted motion with my hand
—“Just someone outside Palihouse.” Todd craned his neck but didn’t see
anyone—she was already gone. He shrugged and looked back at his phone. I
realized that the satellite radio was tuned to the Totally 80s station and the
chorus from “Vienna” by Ultravox was playing—It means nothing to me, the
singer cried out, this means nothing to me—as the fear kept swirling forward,
a variation on that same fear from the fall of 1981, when we played this song
near the end of every party or made sure of its prominence on every mixtape
we compiled. Letting the song take me back on that December day, I thought
I’d acquired the tools to cope with the events that happened when I was
seventeen and I even thought, naïvely, foolishly, that I had worked it out
through the trauma in the fiction I published years later, in my twenties and
thirties and into my forties, but that specific trauma rushed back to me,
proving that whatever I thought I’d worked out on my own, without having to
confess it in a novel, I obviously hadn’t.
That week we were in the desert I couldn’t sleep—perhaps a couple of
hours each night at the most even with a steady intake of benzodiazepine. I
might have knocked myself out with the Xanax I’d overdosed on but the
black dreams kept me from sleeping for more than one or two hours, and I
would lie awake exhausted in the master bedroom in the house on Azure
Court combating the rising panic tied to the girl I had seen. The midlife crisis
that began after that night in 2006 when I tried to write about what happened
to us our senior year at Buckley, completed itself roughly seven years later—
seven years spent in a fever dream where the free-floating anxiety alienated
everyone I knew and the accompanying stress caused me to drop forty
pounds—waned away with the help of a therapist, a kind of life coach whom
I dutifully saw every week for a year in an office off Sawtelle Boulevard just
a block past the 405 who was the only one out of half a dozen shrinks I’d
seen not afraid of the things I was telling him. I had learned from the
previous five therapists that I had to downplay the horror of what had
happened—to me, to us—and that I had to rearrange the narrative so that it
was more palatable in order not to disturb the sessions themselves.
I was finally in a long-term relationship and the minor problems that
never actually threatened my life—addiction, depression—crept away.
People who had been avoiding me those last seven years, when I was
emaciated and furious, would run into the new Bret in a restaurant or at a
screening and seemed confused when they saw I wasn’t as freaked out and
messed up as I used to be. And the prince-of-darkness literary persona
readers thought I had always embodied was now vanishing, being replaced
by something sunnier—the man who wrote American Psycho was actually,
some people were surprised to find out, just an amiable mess, maybe even
likable, and not nearly the careless nihilist so many people mistook me for, an
image that I perhaps played along with anyway. But it had never been the
intended pose.
—
SHE WAS STANDING across the street from a CVS pharmacy that used to
be, decades ago, a New Wave roller-disco rink called Flipper’s, and on the
way out to Palm Springs the sight of the woman caused me to remember the
last time I had been to Flipper’s, in the spring of 1981, before Robert Mallory
appeared that September and everything changed. I was with Thom Wright
and two other guys from our class at Buckley, Jeff Taylor and Kyle Colson—
we were four seventeen-year-old high-school students in the convertible
Rolls-Royce of a mildly infamous but harmless gay con man in his early
forties named Ron Levin who Jeff Taylor had introduced to the group, all of
us a little wired from the cocaine we had done at Ron’s condo in Beverly
Hills earlier that evening. This was actually on a school night during the
middle of our junior year and what this might suggest about our adolescence
is, I suppose, open to interpretation. It also might suggest something about
our world that Jeff, a handsome surfer who—after Thom Wright—was the
second- or third-best-looking guy in our class, was supplying Ron Levin with
mild sexual favors for cash even though Jeff was straight, most of it going to
a new surfboard, stereo equipment and a weed supplier in Zuma.
It might also suggest something about our world that Ron Levin was
murdered a few years later by two members of something called the
Billionaire Boys Club—an investment and social group collective made up of
many of the guys we vaguely knew from the private-school scene in Los
Angeles, guys who went to the Harvard School for Boys, which, along with
the Buckley School, was one of the two most prestigious private schools in
Los Angeles, and students from both places often knew each other in the
vaguely exclusive world of prep schools then. Later, I would meet the
founder of the Billionaire Boys Club, a guy my age named Joe Hunt, during
winter break from Bennington at a casual dinner with a few friends at La
Scala Boutique in Beverly Hills in the months preceding Ron Levin’s murder
at the hands of BBC’s security director that Joe ordered, and nothing about
Joe Hunt, tall and handsome and quiet, ever suggested he would be capable
of the crimes he was later imprisoned for.
I’m digressing because what happened to us that fall in 1981 had nothing
to do with the Billionaire Boys Club or Ron Levin or Joe Hunt. This was just
a segment of where the world we were a part of was heading toward during
that deep span of empire, and by the time the Billionaire Boys Club
“happened” in 1983, what “happened” to us had already occurred, and it was
perhaps the casually hedonistic world of adults we were eagerly entering that
opened a door that allowed Robert Mallory and the Trawler and the events of
that fall to greet us—it later seemed, at least to me, an invitation we
thoughtlessly sent out completely unaware of the price we would end up
paying.
—
FLIPPER’S LOOMED CLOSER on that spring night in Ron Levin’s
convertible Rolls-Royce as we headed up La Cienega into West Hollywood
from Beverly Hills, Donna Summer singing “Dim All the Lights” from the
car’s stereo, off the eight-track of Bad Girls. Ron was driving and Jeff was in
the passenger seat, Kyle and Thom and myself in the back, but I could see
from where I was squeezed between Thom and Kyle that Ron’s hand was on
Jeff’s thigh and then Jeff gently pushed Ron’s hand away without looking at
him. Thom had leaned over and saw this after I nudged him and glanced at
me with a shrug, rolling his eyes, whatever. Did the shrug imply that this was
simply where we all were and we were okay with it? I wondered hopefully as
I glanced back at Thom Wright. But we really didn’t care: we were high and
young and it was a warm spring night and entering into the world of adults—
nothing else mattered. This night in 1981 took place before a placid and
beautiful summer in L.A.—the summer before the horror began, though we
found out it had actually started before that summer, had already been
unfolding in ways we weren’t aware—and that night, which I remember few
specific details of, seems in retrospect like one of the last innocent nights of
my life despite the fact that we should have never been there, underage and
slightly high on cocaine and with a much older gay man who would be
murdered three years later by one of our private-school peers.
I don’t remember roller-skating but I remember sitting in a booth
drinking champagne, the Xanadu soundtrack blasting, and I remember that
we went back to Ron’s apartment in Beverly Hills and Ron casually
disappeared into the bedroom with Jeff—he wanted to show Jeff a new Rolex
he’d just bought. Kyle drove back to his parents’ in Brentwood while Thom
and I did some more coke and played records (and I remember those records
that night: Duran Duran, Billy Idol, Squeeze), before I eventually left, while
Thom waited for Jeff, and after Ron passed out the two of them headed to
Jeff’s father’s place in Malibu, where they stayed up the rest of the night and
finished the half-gram Ron gave Jeff and hit the beach in their wet suits at
dawn to surf the waves cresting along the misty morning shores before they
put on their school uniforms and made the long drive to Buckley, taking
Sunset all the way to Beverly Glen and then over the hill into Sherman Oaks.
Hours earlier I had already driven through the canyons back to my parents’
place on Mulholland, where I took a Valium I found in a Gucci pillbox—the
pillbox a Christmas gift from Susan Reynolds when I was fifteen and maybe
another clue about where we all were—before falling into an easy and
dreamless sleep.
—
WE WERE SO autonomous at sixteen but it never seemed like it was to our
youthful detriment, because the week you got your driver’s license in L.A.
was when you became an adult. I remember when Jeff Taylor first got his car
before any of us and on a school night picked up Thom Wright in Beverly
Hills and then dropped by the house on Mulholland to get me and then drove
into Hollywood with the eight-track of Billy Joel’s Glass Houses blasting
“You May Be Right” and we went to see a late show of Saturn 3 in a deserted
Cinerama Dome—this was in February of 1980. I don’t remember the movie
—R-rated sci-fi starring Farrah Fawcett—only the freedom of being out on
our own and without any parents involved. This was the first time we had
driven by ourselves to see a ten o’clock movie and I remember hanging out in
the vast parking lot of the Cinerama Dome as midnight neared, a deserted
Hollywood surrounding us, sharing a joint, the future wide open.
It was not unusual after I got my driver’s license to decide at seven
o’clock on a Wednesday after browsing my homework that I would drive
down the hill from the house on Mulholland and into West Hollywood to see
the first set of the Psychedelic Furs at the Whisky without asking my
mother’s permission (my parents were separated by that point in 1980),
because this had become a common weeknight out. I would just let my
mother know that I’d be back by midnight and then I’d slip out of the house
and drive through the empty canyons with Missing Persons or the Doors
playing and park in a lot off Sunset where I’d pay five dollars to the attendant
on North Clark. I would easily get into the Whisky with a fake ID (some
nights I wasn’t even carded) and in the club I’d ask the Rastafarian by the bar
if he knew where I could get any coke and the Rastafarian would usually
point to a kid with platinum-blond hair in the back of the room, whom I’d
walk over to and gesture at, slipping him a wad of folded cash before I
ordered a whiskey sour, which was a drink I favored in high school, waiting
for him as he checked something out in the manager’s office and then
brought me a small packet. Afterward I would drive up the canyons and then
cruise along Mulholland—everything was deserted, I was high, smoking a
clove cigarette—and descend Laurel Canyon and drive along the
neighborhoods nestled above Ventura Boulevard: I’d start in Studio City and
then glide through Sherman Oaks slowly in the darkness along Valley Vista
until I arrived in Encino and then, past that, into Tarzana, just idly driving by
the darkened houses that lined the suburban neighborhoods, listening to the
Kings until it was time to head back up to Mulholland. I’d take either Ventura
Boulevard or the 101 and at Van Nuys make the drive up Beverly Glen, and
sometimes while heading home catch the green flashes from the eyes of
coyotes in the glare of the headlights as they glanced at the Mercedes while
trotting across Mulholland—sometimes in packs—and I’d have to stop the
car, waiting to let them prowl past. And I could always manage the next
morning, no matter how late my nights played out, to pull into the Buckley
parking lot, neatly wearing my uniform, minutes before the first class began,
never feeling hungover or tired but only pleasantly buzzed.
—
IF THE SPRING AND SUMMER of 1981 had been the dream, something
paradisaical, then September represented the end of that dream with the
arrival of Robert Mallory—there was now the sense of something else
moving in, dark patterns were revealing themselves, and we began noticing
things for the first time: a signal we had never heard before started calling out
to us. I don’t want to make a direct connection between certain events and the
arrival of Robert Mallory in September of 1981 after that paradisaical
summer but it happened to coincide with a kind of madness that slowly
descended over the city. It was as if another world was announcing itself,
painting the one we had all safely taken for granted into a darker color.
For example, this became a time when homes in certain neighborhoods
were suddenly being targeted and staked out by members of a cult whose
purpose was hard to ascertain, the pale hippie hanging out at the end of the
driveway muttering to himself, his pacing interrupted by a brief shuffledance, and later, in December, there were plastic explosives planted all over
town by the cult the hippies belonged to. There was suddenly a sniper on the
roof of a department store in Beverly Hills on the night before Thanksgiving,
and there was a bomb threat that cleared out Chasen’s on Christmas Eve.
Suddenly we knew about a teenage boy who had convinced himself he was
possessed by a “Satanic demon” in Pacific Palisades and the elaborate
exorcism by two priests to rid the boy of the demon, which almost killed him
—the boy bled from his eyes and went deaf in one ear, developed
pancreatitis, and four ribs were broken during the ritual. Suddenly there was
the UCLA student buried alive as a prank by five classmates high on PCP at a
fraternity party that a witness blandly said had “somehow gotten out of hand”
and who almost didn’t make it, ending up in a coma in a darkened room in
one of the buildings lining Medical Plaza. Suddenly there were the spider
infestations that bloomed everywhere across the city. The most fanciful story
that fall involved a mutation, a monster, a fish the size of a small car hauled
out of the ocean off Malibu—its skin was gray-white and there were large
patches of silvery-orange scales dusted across it and even though it had the
jaws of a shark it decidedly wasn’t one, and when the thing was gutted by
local fishermen they found the bodies of two dogs who had been missing
swallowed whole.
And then, of course, there was the Trawler announcing itself.
For about a year there had been various break-ins and assaults, and then
disappearances, and in 1981, the corpse of a second missing teenage girl was
found—the other one discovered in 1980—and was ultimately connected to
the home invasions. Everything might have happened without the presence of
Robert Mallory but the fact that his arrival coincided with the strange
darkening that had begun to lightly spiral into our lives was something I
couldn’t ignore, even though others did, at their own peril. Whether it was
bad luck or bad timing these events were simply tied together, and though
Robert Mallory wasn’t the sniper on the roof of Neiman Marcus or the caller
who emptied out Chasen’s and he wasn’t connected to the violent exorcism
in Pacific Palisades or anywhere near the fraternity house in Westwood
where the pledge had been flung into an open grave, his presence, for me,
was connected to all of these things; every horror story we heard that fall,
anything that darkened our bubble in ways we never noticed before, led to
him.
—
A WEEK AGO I ordered a reproduction of the 1982 Buckley yearbook from
a website called Classmates.com for ninety-nine dollars and it was FedExed
four days later to the apartment on Doheny and when it arrived I remembered
why I didn’t have a copy: I never wanted to be reminded of the things that
happened to me and the friends we lost. Our yearbook was called Images, and
this edition was overseen by a classmate who became a well-known producer
in Hollywood and she gave 1982 a cinematic theme: interspersed throughout
the yearbook were stills of movies, everything from Gone with the Wind to
Ordinary People, which seemed, in retrospect to what happened, almost
unnaturally frivolous and uncaring, a way of forcing a lipstick smile onto a
death mask. While slowly turning the pages of the “Seniors” section, where
each of us had an individual page to reminisce and thank our parents and add
photos of friends and quotations, designing the page to represent who we
thought we were at eighteen, our best selves, I was haunted by the fact that
out of the sixty seniors from that class of 1982 five were missing—the five
who didn’t make it for various reasons—and this fact was simply
inescapable: I couldn’t dream it away or pretend it wasn’t true. We were
listed alphabetically and after sipping from a tumbler of gin I would
tentatively turn to where each of them would have been placed within those
sixty pages and notice that they simply weren’t there—they had all existed
that first week in September but now they were erased. Instead three of them
were listed in the “In Memoriam” section at the back of the book.

I REMEMBER IT WAS THE SUNDAY afternoon before Labor Day in 1981
and our senior year was about to begin on that Tuesday morning of
September 8—and I remember that the Windover Stables were located on a
bluff above Malibu, where Deborah Schaffer was boarding her new horse,
Spirit, in one of the twenty separate barns where the animals were housed,
and I remember I was driving solo, following Susan Reynolds and Thom
Wright in Thom’s convertible Corvette along Pacific Coast Highway, the
ocean dimly shimmering beside us in the humid air, until we reached the
turnoff that took us up to the stables, and I remember I was listening to the
Cars, the song was “Dangerous Type”—on a mixtape I’d made that included
Blondie, the Babys, Duran Duran—as I kept behind Thom’s car up the
winding road to the entrance of the stables, where we parked next to
Deborah’s gleaming brand-new BMW, the only car in the lot on that Sunday,
and then checked in at the front office, and where we followed a tree-lined
trail until we located Debbie trotting Spirit by his reins around a gated arena
that was deserted—she had already ridden him but the saddle was still on and
she was wearing her riding attire. The sight of the horse shocked me—and I
remember that I shivered at its presence in the late-afternoon heat. Spirit had
replaced a horse Debbie retired in June.
“Hey,” Debbie said to us in her flat, uninflected voice. I remember how
it sounded so hollow in the emptiness that surrounded us—a deadened echo.
Beyond the manicured stables painted white and pine green was a forest of
trees blocking the view of the Pacific—you could see small patches of glassy
blue but everything seemed ensconced and still, nothing moved, as if we
were encased in a kind of plastic dome. I remember it being very hot that day
and I felt that I had somehow been forced into visiting the stables simply
because Debbie had become my girlfriend that summer and it was required of
me and not something I necessarily wanted to experience. But I was resigned:
I may have wanted to stay home and work on the novel I was writing, but at
seventeen I also wanted to keep up certain appearances.
I remember Thom said “Wow” as he neared the horse, and, like
everything with Thom, it might have sounded genuine, but it was also, like
Debbie’s intonation, flat, as if he didn’t really have an opinion: everything
was cool, everything was chill, everything was a mild wow. Susan murmured
in agreement as she took off her Wayfarers.
“Hey, handsome,” Debbie said to me, placing a kiss on my cheek.
I remember I tried to stare admiringly at the animal but I really didn’t
want to care about the horse—and yet it was so large and alive that I was
shocked by it. Up close it was kind of magnificent, and it definitely made an
impression on me—it just seemed too huge, and only made of muscle, a
threat—It could hurt you, I thought—but it was actually calm, and in that
moment had no problem letting us stroke its flanks. I remember that I was
aware of Spirit being yet another example of Debbie’s wealth and her
intertwined carelessness: the cost of maintaining and housing the animal
would be astronomical and yet who knew how interested she really was at
seventeen and if that interest was going to be sustained. But this was another
aspect I hadn’t known about Debbie even though we had been going to
school together since fifth grade—I hadn’t paid attention until now: I found
out she’d always been interested in horses and yet I never knew it until the
summer before our senior year, when I became her boyfriend and saw the
shelves in her bedroom lined with ribbons and trophies and photographs of
her at various equestrian events. I had always been more interested in her
father, Terry Schaffer, than I was in Debbie. In 1981 Terry Schaffer was
thirty-nine and already extremely wealthy, having made the bulk of his
fortune on a few movies that had—in two unexpected cases—become
blockbusters, and he was one of the town’s most respected and in-demand
producers. He had taste, or at least what Hollywood considered taste—he had
been nominated for an Oscar twice—and he was constantly offered jobs to
run studios, something he had no interest in. Terry was also gay—not openly
but discreetly—and he was married to Liz Schaffer, who was lost in so much
privilege and pain that I wondered if Terry’s gayness registered with her at all
anymore. Deborah was their only child. Terry died in 1992.
—
THOM WAS ASKING Debbie general questions about the horse and Susan
glanced over at me and smiled—I rolled my eyes, not at Thom, but at the
overall non-situation. Susan rolled her eyes back at me: a connection was
made between us that didn’t involve our respective mates. After petting and
admiring the horse there didn’t seem much reason for us to be standing
around anymore and I remember thinking: This is why I drove all the way out
to Malibu? In order to witness and pet Debbie’s dumb new horse? And I
remember I stood there feeling somewhat awkward, though I’m sure neither
Thom nor Susan did: they were almost never annoyed, nothing ever ruffled
Thom or Susan, they took everything in stride, and the eye-rolling on Susan’s
part seemed designed to simply placate me, but I was grateful. Debbie kissed
my lips lightly.
“See you back at my place?” she asked.
I was momentarily distracted by the whispered conversation Thom and
Susan were having before I turned my attention to Debbie. I remembered
Debbie was having people over that night at the house in Bel Air and I smiled
naturally in order to reassure her.
“Yeah, totally.”
And then, on cue, as if everything was rehearsed, Thom and Susan and I
walked back to our cars as Debbie walked Spirit into his stable, with
someone from the Windover staff, uniformed in white jeans and a
windbreaker. I followed Thom and Susan along PCH and as they made the
left turn onto Sunset Boulevard, which would take us all the way from the
beach to the entrance of Bel Air’s East Gate, a song that I liked but would
never admit to was now playing on the mixtape: REO Speedwagon’s “Time
for Me to Fly,” a sappy ballad about a loser who gets up the nerve to tell his
girlfriend it’s over, and yet for me at seventeen it was a song about
metamorphosis and the lyric I know it hurts to say goodbye, but it’s time for
me to fly…meant something else that spring and summer of 1981, when I
became attached to the song. It was about leaving one realm and moving into
another, just as I had been doing. And I remember being at the stables not
because anything happened there—it was just Thom and Susan and myself
driving out to Malibu to see the horse—but because it was the afternoon that
led into the night where we first heard the name of a new student who would
be joining our senior class that fall at Buckley: Robert Mallory.
—
THOM WRIGHT AND SUSAN REYNOLDS had been dating since they
were sophomores—and were now the most popular people not only in our
class but in the overall Buckley student body after Katie Choi and Brad
Foreman graduated in June and it was obvious why: Thom and Susan were
casually beautiful, all-American, dark-blond hair, green eyes, perpetually tan,
and there was something logical in the way they had gravitated inexorably
toward each other and moved everywhere as a single unit—they were almost
always together. They both came from wealthy L.A. families but Thom’s
parents were divorced and his father had relocated to New York, and it was
only on those trips to Manhattan where Thom visited his dad that he wasn’t
in direct proximity to Susan. For about two years they were in love, until that
fall of 1981, when one of them wasn’t, which set into motion a series of
dreadful events. I had been infatuated with both of them but I never admitted
to either one that it was actually love.
I had been Susan’s closest male friend since we met at Buckley in the
seventh grade and five years later I knew seemingly everything about her:
when she got her period, the problems with her mother, every imaginary
slight and deprivation she thought she was enduring, crushes on classmates
before Thom. She kind of knew that I was secretly in love with her, but even
though we were always close she never said anything, only teased me at
certain moments if I was paying too much attention to her, or not enough. I
had been flattered that people thought we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I
did little to stop the rumors about the two of us until Thom stepped in. Susan
Reynolds was the prototype of the cool SoCal girl even at thirteen, years
before she was driving a convertible BMW and always mildly stoned on
marijuana or Valium or half a Quaalude (but functioning—she was an
effortless A student) and impudently wearing Wayfarer sunglasses as she
walked through the arched stucco doorways to her class unless a teacher
asked her to take them off—every Buckley student seemed in possession of a
designer pair of sunglasses but they weren’t allowed to be worn on campus
except in the parking lot and on Gilley Field. Susan seemed to confide
everything to me during the middle-school years—in the 1970s they were
referred to as “junior high”—and though I didn’t quite return that openness I
had revealed enough for her to know things about me that no one else did, but
only to a point. There were things I would never tell her.
Susan Reynolds became the de facto queen of our class as we moved
through each subsequent grade: she was beautiful, sophisticated, intriguingly
low-key, and she had an air of casual sexuality even before she and Thom
became a couple—and it wasn’t because she was slutty; she had actually lost
her virginity to Thom and hadn’t had sex with anyone else—but Susan’s
beauty always intensified the idea of her sexuality for us. Thom ultimately
took it a step further and Susan’s sexual aura became more pronounced once
they started dating, when everyone knew that they were fucking, but it had
always been there; and even if they hadn’t actually been fucking in the
beginning, during those first weeks that fall of 1979, when they became a
couple, the question was: how could two teenagers that good-looking not be
fucking each other? By September of 1981 Susan and I were still close and,
in some ways, I think she felt closer to me than to Thom—we had, of course,
a different relationship—but there now seemed to be a slight wariness, not
necessarily toward anything in particular but just a general malaise. She had
been with Thom for two years and a vague but noticeable ennui had drifted
over her. The jealousy that they inspired and that had almost broken me was,
I thought, dissolving by then.
—
THOM WRIGHT, LIKE SUSAN REYNOLDS, HAD started Buckley in
seventh grade, transferring from Horace Mann. His parents divorced when he
was in ninth grade and he lived with his mother in Beverly Hills when his
father relocated to Manhattan. Though Thom had always been cute—
obviously the cutest guy in our class, adorable even—it wasn’t until
something happened to him over the summer of 1979, when he returned from
New York after spending July and August with his father, that he’d
somehow, inexplicably, become a man; some kind of metamorphosis had
happened that summer, the cuteness and the adorability had faded, and we
started looking at Thom in a different way—he was suddenly, officially,
sexualized when we saw him back at school that September of our
sophomore year. Even though I had always sexualized Thom Wright
everyone else now realized he was built, the jawline seemed more
pronounced, the hair was now shorter—somewhat ubiquitous among the guys
at Buckley (mostly because of haircut regulations) but Thom’s was now
something stylish, a moment, a cue to manliness—and when I glimpsed him
in the locker room that first week back from the summer changing for Phys
Ed (our lockers throughout our time at Buckley were side by side) I hitched
in a breath when I saw he had obviously been working out and his chest and
arms and torso were defined in ways they weren’t at the end of June, the last
time I saw him in a bathing suit, at a pool party at Anthony Matthews’s
house. There was also the paleness around his newly muscled thighs and ass
—the place where his bathing suit had blocked the sun from his weekends in
the Hamptons—that contrasted with the rest of his tanned body, which
shocked me. Thom had become an ideal of teen boy handsomeness and what
was so alluring about him was that he seemed not to care, he seemed not to
notice, as if it was just a natural gift bestowed upon him—he didn’t have an
ego. I had repeatedly gotten over any notions that my feelings for Thom
Wright would be reciprocated, because he was so resolutely heterosexual in
ways that I wasn’t.
This inchoate crush on Thom may have come back those first few weeks
after he returned from New York that September in 1979 but then he was
suddenly with Susan and we effortlessly became a kind of threesome once we
got cars that following spring, hanging out on weekends, going to the movies
together in Westwood, lying on the sand at the Jonathan Beach Club in Santa
Monica and cruising the Century City Mall, and my crush on both Thom and
Susan was rendered pointless. Not that Thom would have ever noticed it,
though Susan, I’m sure, had registered my feelings and knew I desired her:
Thom was, admittedly, a fairly unaware individual—about a lot of things—
and yet there was an intriguing blankness that was attractive and soothing
about him, there was never any tension, he was the pinnacle of laid-back and
he wasn’t a stoner. By the time we finished junior year the only drug Thom
liked was coke, and only just a line or two, a few bumps could take him
through a party, and he didn’t drink except for the occasional Corona. He was
so easy to hang with and so agreeable to any option that when I fantasized
coming on to him I often dreamt he would have let me, at least halfway,
before gently rejecting my advances, though not without a kiss and a
suggestive squeeze on my upper thigh to uselessly reassure me. In some of
my more elaborate fantasies Thom didn’t reject me sexually and these would
end with both of us covered in sweat and in my dreams the sex was
exaggeratedly intense and afterward, I’d imagine, he would kiss me deeply,
panting, quietly laughing, amazed at the pleasure I brought him, in ways that
Susan Reynolds never could.
—
I DIDN’T WANT DEBBIE SCHAFFER to kiss me at the Windover Stables
that afternoon in front of Thom and Susan but I hadn’t minded either. In a
way she was an experiment—I wasn’t determined to have a girlfriend my
senior year at Buckley except if it had been Susan Reynolds—and yet Debbie
had become, somewhat inexplicably, exactly that at the beginning of the
summer. We were at another party at Anthony Matthews’s house and she just
started making out with me on a chaise by the lit pool. I was stoned on a
Quaalude, she was on coke, it was midnight, Split Enz’s “I Got You” was
playing from inside the house (…I don’t know why sometimes I get
frightened…) and I was at a point where I still tried to be attracted to girls—
that hadn’t ended yet—and all the requisite elements seemed to be in play.
She simply pushed herself onto me and I surprised myself and went with it. I
really didn’t care about appearances—though I definitely wasn’t out as
bisexual and I had no desire to lead a girl or a guy on—but I was also fairly
passive, and when it came to Debbie Schaffer, whom I had known since the
fifth grade, I just went with whatever she wanted that summer, and I thought
including her might round out the group of Susan and Thom and myself,
make it less painful for me, hopefully inspire one of them to become jealous,
which of course never happened. I also wanted to get closer to Debbie so it
might bring me nearer to Terry Schaffer, the famous dad, who I’d always
been drawn to and yet after all these years never really knew, and I’d known
Debbie seemingly forever.
Debbie had transformed from a somewhat awkward-looking girl—
though always bizarrely confident, or maybe just entitled, but pudgy with
braces and a ponytail—into a kind of slutty teen boy fantasy by the time she
reached ninth grade. Her breasts were full and high and she took every
opportunity to show off her cleavage. A Buckley girl wasn’t supposed to
reveal this, the white blouse was supposed to be buttoned to the point where
you couldn’t see anything, but many of the girls ignored this rule in tenth and
eleventh grade and, depending on what adult glimpsed this, it had become
allowed—the rules were malleable. Her legs were stunning, long and tan and
waxed, and the saddle shoes she wore with ankle-high white socks helped
turn her into something fetishistic; the hem on the gray skirt of her uniform
was at the highest permissible length so you could see past upper-thigh, and
often when she sat down you just as easily glimpsed the light-pink panties
she was fond of. By senior year her hair was a shade off platinum, Blondieinspired, and though makeup was against the rules for younger girls (lip gloss
was acceptable), if you were in eleventh or twelfth grade it was allowed
minimally, and often girls casually wore understated lipstick though Debbie
wore hers defiantly, hot pink and blood red, even though she was often asked
by a teacher or our principal, Dr. Croft, to wipe it off. Susan barely wore any
makeup at all because Thom didn’t like it.
—
EVEN THOUGH AS A COUPLE THOM AND SUSAN, in my mind,
seemed more defined than anything else in the minimalist moment we were
moving through in 1981, which was inspired by New Wave and punk—
numbness and disaffection, a general rejection of seventies kitsch, everything
was clean with sharp angles now—they were a throwback to a distant era
despite how up-to-date and effortlessly hip both of them outwardly seemed—
they often acted as if they could have been the king and queen of the prom
from a movie made in the early 1960s: happy, carefree, untroubled. But I
knew at a certain point—by the late spring of 1981, almost two years after
they started dating—that Thom was happier than Susan. She had recently
confided to me one day near the end of our junior year as we walked through
Westwood after school in our Buckley uniforms while Thom was at baseball
practice that “Thom isn’t dumb exactly…” She said this apropos of nothing,
and I didn’t know how to respond—I just looked over at her. It was true: his
grades were good, he kept them up—he had to because of the sports he
played and excelled at: football, basketball, soccer, baseball, track—and he
read and admired books (as sophomores we bonded over how much we both
liked The Great Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises) and he had become almost
as much of a cinephile as I was, often accompanying me to revival theaters
like the Nuart, where I would educate him about the differences between
good Robert Altman and bad, and why Brian De Palma was an important
director. “But Thom can be—” Susan started, then stopped herself. I
remember she chose the following words carefully as we stood in front of the
Postermat, debating whether to go in. Outland, a movie set on one of
Jupiter’s moons, was playing next door at the Bruin, I remember. “Not dim,”
she said, then pausing. “But uncurious.”
Well, Thom didn’t need to be anything, I argued, kind of joking. He was
hot, his family had money, Thom would be okay whether he was dumb or
not. What was she trying to say?
Susan looked at me strangely after I said this, seemingly bothered that I
was overly effusive about defending something so innocuous and vague.
“You’re hardly not hot, Bret,” Susan said as we slowly floated across the
sidewalk.
I was swinging a yellow Tower Records bag (Squeeze, East Side Story,
the Kim Carnes LP with “Bette Davis Eyes”) and tried to seem utterly
nonchalant when I said, “But I’m not Thom.”
This annoyed her. “God, you sound like you want to date him.”
“Date?” I said, smirking. “Is that a possibility?” I was joking but I
wanted to test her.
Susan glanced at me, smiling at first, and coy, Wayfarers on, lips lightly
touched with bubble-gum gloss, and then she said seriously, “No, I don’t
think so. No, it isn’t.”
The way she answered this with such a casual finality annoyed me.
“Jesus, Susan, I’m kidding,” I said, even though, of course, I wasn’t.
Susan didn’t say anything as we crossed Broxton, just kept looking over
at me even though I couldn’t see her eyes because of the Wayfarers—she was
trying to figure something out.
I asked, “How do you know Thom wouldn’t?”
She finally sighed and said, “Oh, Bret, I hope you’re happy. I really do.
Your secret is safe with me.”
I laughed and said, “You don’t know my secrets.”
But we were finding missing pieces and secrets everywhere and I had
more than a few and in that moment I wondered which ones Susan knew,
which ones she had uncovered, and which ones remained mysteries.
—
EVERYTHING SPED UP when you got your car at sixteen: you were now
autonomous in ways you hadn’t been, you could take care of yourself or so
you thought—that was the illusion—and now that we were older, and
especially if we didn’t have siblings—which strangely none of us had, not
Thom, not Susan or Deborah, not Matt Kellner, or myself—this encouraged
our parents to either work longer hours or travel with less restrictions, many
of them to distant movie sets in other countries, or they were simply taking
more elaborate vacations, leaving behind empty houses in Bel Air and
Beverly Hills and Benedict Canyon and along the cliffs of Mulholland and
into Malibu that we took advantage of our junior year. And because of this
new autonomy and mobility we were driving over to a friend’s house
whenever we wanted or hanging at the beach club on a whim, and some of
the boys were now openly purchasing porn at the newsstands in Sherman
Oaks and Studio City or sometimes driving into West L.A. or Hollywood to
flash a fake ID and buy magazines and videotapes.
We also started spending time at the Odyssey, an all-age nightclub on
Beverly Boulevard near the corner of La Cienega, which didn’t serve alcohol
but if you knew your way around you could score Quaaludes and weed and
small baggies of cocaine, and for me, at least, the Odyssey had the added
allure that there were gay men in attendance even though it was ostensibly a
straight club; and though the gay men were perhaps older than I wanted to
pursue, this was the first time I was in close proximity to them and it had
been mildly thrilling even though I didn’t do anything, just danced with
Thom and Susan and Jeff and sometimes Debbie and Anthony and whoever
else was there until two or three in the morning on weekends, and with our
parents mostly absent that spring we could roll home whenever we wanted,
sleep late, and then do it all over again—this was what the cars afforded us.
—
WE ALSO DIDN’T HAVE TO DEPEND on our parents’ driving us into
Westwood Village, where we would meet up to watch two or three or even
four movies (if we were feeling particularly ambitious), which is how we
spent our Saturdays, catching up on everything that opened Friday—the
group evolving every weekend depending on what movies were playing and
who wanted to see what, usually myself and Thom, Jeff and Anthony, maybe
Kyle and Dominic. We would decide on Saturday mornings in a number of
overlapping phone calls while going through the “Calendar” section of the
Los Angeles Times on what to see (the only way in 1981 to find out what was
playing where and when) and by a certain point the group scheduled where
we’d be exactly throughout the day, so the girls would know where to meet
us later. The girls were usually not interested in the two or three matinees we
planned on seeing and they would meet us for a light dinner, usually sushi at
a place we frequented just below Le Conte Avenue, a half-block from the
Village Theater, and the last movie of the night.
The guys would start the day by meeting for lunch somewhere at noon—
a favorite was Yesterdays and the Monte Cristo sandwich they served, or
we’d take the street-level elevator down into the Good Earth, a modish
upscale health-food restaurant where we drank giant glasses of cinnamonflavored iced tea and ate salads, or we’d crowd into one of the red booths at
Hamburger Hamlet for patty melts after buying our tickets for the next movie
at the Bruin, adjacent on Weyburn. Dinner was sometimes at the Chart House
or the old-school Italian of Mario’s, with breaks spent at the Westworld video
arcade playing Space Invaders and Pac-Man or browsing the Postermat while
sixties girl groups blared or looking for new music at Tower Records or the
Wherehouse or leafing through paperbacks at any number of the large
bookstores that dotted the streets—there were five or six in 1981, there are
none now. The night would end at Ships, a retro coffee shop on Wilshire,
situated along the edges of Westwood Village, with a boomerang-shaped roof
and atomic neon sign, and where we’d order Cokes and vanilla milkshakes
and smoke clove cigarettes, ashtrays and a separate toaster on each table, and
stay out until after midnight. We were taking tentative advantage of the
newfound freedom that had opened up to us—activating something in our
group that made us want to become adults fast and leave what now seemed
like the stifling world of childhood behind. Time for me to fly…
—
IN LATE MAY OF 1980—May 23, to be exact—The Shining opened, and I
wanted to see it as soon as possible.
I’d read the novel when it was published in 1977, already a big fan of
Stephen King, having practically memorized Carrie and Salem’s Lot, his first
two books, and The Shining scared me mightily as a thirteen-year-old: the
haunted Overlook Hotel, the angry and alcoholic father possessed and driven
murderous by the spirits of the place, the frightened son in peril, REDRUM, the
hedge animals that came alive. I was obsessed and it remains one of the key
novels that made me want to be a writer. In fact as soon as I was done
reading The Shining for a third time I began writing my own novel in the
summer of 1978, which I was still working on in the late spring of 1980,
though about to abandon it in favor of what ultimately became Less Than
Zero.
When I heard that Stanley Kubrick was adapting The Shining on a lavish
scale I was immediately distracted—it became the most anticipated movie in
my lifetime, and I closely followed its troubled production (delays, endless
takes, a fire destroyed the main set, the ramping costs), and I don’t think I’ve
ever tracked the making of a movie with more interest—not even the ones
that were later made from my novels gripped me as much as what Kubrick
was going to do with The Shining. I was almost paralyzed with anticipation.
And then a trailer dropped late in 1979; it was simple, almost minimalist, just
an image—how one longs for trailers that didn’t lay out the entire movie like
today’s three-act previews—of an elevator in the Overlook whose doors seem
to be slowly pushing open because the cabin is filled with blood that starts
pouring out in slow motion and then cascades toward us in waves until the
blood crashes against the camera, turning the lens red, the credits of the
movie rolling upward in neon blue over this one image. I saw the trailer many
times during the fall of 1979 and throughout the first half of 1980 and it never
failed to rivet me. I began counting the days—the hours—before I could see
the actual movie.
I couldn’t go on the 23rd because of school and I didn’t want to face
Westwood on a crowded Friday night, so my plan was to go the next day—
Saturday, May 24—and I wanted to see the 10:00 a.m. showing because I
knew it would be less crowded than any of the later screenings. Surprisingly
everyone argued for 1:00 p.m. at the Village—it was a Saturday, they wanted
to sleep in, 10 was way too early. I argued to Thom and Jeff that the lines
would be too long later in the day, since it was an exclusive engagement only
playing at three theaters in Los Angeles, but everyone eventually bowed out
and said they’d meet me for lunch at D. B. Levy’s, a deli we frequented on
Lindbrook Drive after the movie was over, and then see The Empire Strikes
Back later that afternoon at the Avco. I was disappointed—I wanted to see
The Shining with Thom—but it didn’t diminish my excitement. This would
be the first time I drove to Westwood by myself to see a movie alone, without
the guys, and I felt incredibly adult as I raced across Mulholland toward
Beverly Glen on that Saturday morning in my father’s hand-down, a metallicgreen Mercedes 450SEL, a four-door tank that was hardly the sporty vehicle I
longed for at sixteen.
—
I PARKED IN THE LOT ON BROXTON across from the Village Theater at
nine-thirty—listening to a mixtape made up entirely of Joe Jackson’s Look
Sharp and I’m the Man with a couple of Clash songs from London Calling
and Elvis Costello’s Armed Forces added in—and was relieved that only a
short line had formed at the box office then being admitted straight into the
theater. I remember, and I don’t know why, that I was wearing a fashionable
new Ralph Lauren shirt, sea green with the insignia of a purple polo pony,
and Calvin Klein jeans with Topsiders—and that I kept my Wayfarer
sunglasses on when I bought my ticket. The Shining was rated R and I was
momentarily worried I’d get carded even though I had a fake ID I barely
used, the city was lax, and I didn’t need it that morning—four dollars for one
adult. Again I was reminded as I moved into the grand lobby—looking at the
carved winged lions that sat halfway up the 170-foot bleached FOX tower,
which loomed over Broxton and Weyburn Avenues, at night lit by a blueand-white sign crowning the tower, its shaft illuminated, a beacon—that this
was the first time I’d come to Westwood alone and I felt genuinely grown-up
and shivered with anticipation at whatever the future held. I bought a box of
Junior Mints and moved from the bright Art Deco lobby into the darkness of
the gigantic auditorium.
The theater was less crowded than I worried it would be but it was only
nine-forty and it was bound to fill up, I thought as I sat and stared at the
massive set of curtains draped in front of the 70-millimeter screen. Writing
this now, I can’t believe that I was left to my own devices for twenty minutes,
just idly sitting there, thinking about things, about Thom and about Susan,
waiting without a phone to look at, waiting without something to distract me.
Instead, I took in the theater—my favorite in Westwood and the largest, with
over fourteen hundred seats; it was its own vast world I took refuge in and it
was one of the few places I was aware I might actually be saved—because
movies were a religion in that moment, they could change you, alter your
perception, you could rise toward the screen and share a moment of
transcendence, all the disappointments and fears would be wiped away for a
few hours in that church: movies acted like a drug for me. But they were also
about control: you were a voyeur sitting in the dark staring at secret things,
because that’s what movies were—scenes you shouldn’t be seeing and that
no one on the screen knew you were watching. These were the things I was
thinking about while I slowly pressed down on a Junior Mint, letting it
dissolve on my tongue, glancing at my watch as the hands moved toward ten
o’clock. The lights in the theater seemed to slowly darken even though there
were still about two minutes before the curtain would rise. The ominous
music from the soundtrack began softly announcing itself in the domed
auditorium: snake rattles and bird trills and wailing horns. I realized,
thrillingly, that there would be no trailers at this showing.
And that’s when I saw the boy.
This is the reason why I’ve never forgotten seeing The Shining on
May 24, 1980, at the Village Theater in Westwood at the 10:00 a.m. show. It
was because of him.
—
I WAS SITTING in the upper echelon of the orchestra section—above me
was a two-tiered balcony that you entered on the third floor of the theater and
that hung over the last ten rows of the orchestra without obscuring your sight
lines—and I was off to the side, near the aisle, when I saw him: a guy around
my age so stunningly handsome that I thought at first he was a movie star or
a model I’d fantasized about from GQ magazine. He seemed to be looking
for someone as he walked up the darkening aisle, everything slowly dimming
around us. His face was a series of cut angles, and he had a full head of blond
unruly hair, short and brushed back, and it stood up, adding to the angularity
of his features; he had full lips and slightly sunken cheeks and an aquiline
nose. He was tall, probably five eleven, slim-waisted, broad-shouldered, and
as he passed I could see his mouth was working, chewing gum, and he was
preoccupied with finding whoever he was looking for, and I could also see
the long eyelashes and I pretended his irises were blue and that he was tan
everywhere. A wave of lust crested hard in my chest and I suddenly ached for
him—the sensation was so immediate and so tidal that I was shocked—and
adding this new presence to the anticipation of watching the movie that was
finally about to begin forced me to slow down my breathing. The boy
aroused something primal in me that I had never felt before—I wanted him
immediately, I needed to be his friend, I had to make contact, I had to see him
naked, I had to own him. I shifted in my seat as the curtains in the theater
were rising, revealing the giant whiteness of the screen—my hands were
gripped into fists and I turned around and craned my neck, hoping to see
where he went.
The Warner Bros. logo headed toward us as the opening credits of The
Shining began over aerial shots of the family’s Volkswagen heading up the
deserted roads toward the Overlook. But I couldn’t get my bearings, because
I now watched as the boy walked down the other aisle. He was farther away
this time but I had a better look at his body: the tightness of his jeans
showcased his ass, tapering up into a long back—this was becoming always
the first thing I noticed about a guy—and I watched mesmerized as this boy,
this god, walked the aisle, disappearing from my sight line. He had to be
older than me, I thought; he was a UCLA student probably, maybe even a
graduate, too manly to still be in high school. I saw him once more, midmovie, as he walked up the aisle again, and I had to control what seemed like
every muscle in my body and not follow him to what I assumed was the
restroom or the concession stand, because he had glanced at me as I watched
him pass by—we made eye contact, he noticed me staring at him—and he
glanced away but not before a kind of lingering gaze took me in, and I
fantasized that he wanted me, too.
After the movie was over—I was underwhelmed, it was nothing like the
book, I felt cheated but also that I needed to be impressed because I had
waited so long to see it—I walked into the lobby hoping to find the boy but
he wasn’t anywhere: not in the line to the men’s room, which I checked out,
and then idly waited to see if he had been, in fact, in there, but he wasn’t, and
when I walked outside to the front of the theater he wasn’t there either. The
crowd for the next show, at 1:00 p.m., was enormous: the line snaking around
the block, along Broxton, and then curving along Le Conte, and then back
down along Gayley and finally to the box-office booth of the theater, creating
an almost unbroken four-block-long square. In addition there seemed to be
hundreds of people outside the Village Theater who weren’t in line, just
talking and lingering below the giant FOX tower, and I lingered there too, only
momentarily, knowing I wouldn’t see that magical boy again but hoping to
catch a glimpse of him anyway. And yet I was glad that I didn’t see him: it
would have been too overwhelming and ultimately tinged with
disappointment, because I could never be for him what he ended up being for
me. I even included a version of him in a short story I was working on that
summer where he became a character I controlled.

AS I FOLLOWED Thom’s car across Sunset on that September afternoon
before Labor Day, weaving along the boulevard’s curves, heading toward Bel
Air, I reflected on the summer that had just passed: hooking up with Debbie,
the weekdays at the beach club, the late nights at Du-par’s after dancing at
the Seven Seas mildly wasted on whiskey sours—the drinking age in L.A.
was twenty-one but everyone had fake IDs—and we’d already left the
teenagers at the Odyssey far behind us; there were the pool parties, usually at
Anthony Matthews’s or Debbie Schaffer’s; we saw Raiders of the Lost Ark at
a preview screening on the Paramount lot courtesy of Terry; a group of us
went to a midnight show of An American Werewolf in London at the Avco in
Westwood the weekend it opened in August, completely stoned,
exaggeratedly laughing and screaming as David Naughton transformed into a
monster, and we started seeing New Wave bands in smaller clubs—we were
moving away from the Eagles at the Long Beach Arena (where we had
watched as they broke up onstage in what would be their last concert for
fifteen years) and Pink Floyd performing The Wall at the Sports Arena last
February—our musical tastes were changing—and instead it was X at the
Whisky, the Go-Go’s at the Starwood, the Plimsouls at the Roxy. It was the
summer that fashions changed: all the boys in our class were wearing Ralph
Lauren Polo shirts in bold Easter-egg colors—pink and blue and green and
purple—something Thom Wright and I’d started, but now worn with the
collar sticking up, and plaid shorts, and cardigan sweaters, and we wore dress
shirts with the logo of the Armani eagle as part of our Buckley uniform, and
Topsiders and penny loafers replaced the standard buckle-up and tennis shoe.
The male fashion in that moment was still streamlined, preppie, at times
vaguely Italian, more The Garden of the Finzi-Continis than The Lost Boys—
we were a long way from shoulder pads and mullets and the clownish kitsch
from the mid-1980s and most boys kept their hair short and dressed neatly
and the girls took their dressier cues from retro classics: Capri pants, bubble
skirts, taffeta. We were trying to look stylish, we were aiming for cool, we
wanted to become adults. It was the August that MTV started airing videos
but none of us had any idea what it would become—the Buggles’ Video
Killed the Radio Star was the first video the channel played, and though we
knew the song and had been listening to the album it came from, The Age of
Plastic, we didn’t know what a bold premonition that song and video would
ultimately morph into.
As I said, the summer of 1981 had been a dream—I liked calling it
paradisaical—and because of this I was envisioning a fairly uncomplicated
senior year unfolding before us, one I would easily move through as if
performing a well-rehearsed part while I figured out my escape, possibly
somewhere along the Eastern Seaboard, perhaps farther, maybe across an
ocean. What an innocent year it was going to be, I thought, driving along
Sunset, so easy and effortless to move through.
—
BY THE END of that summer I’d found out that even though we’d all known
each other at least since seventh grade and we were supposedly such close
friends and there were so many innocent truths we assumed, we were also
realizing that these supposed truths were not, in fact, real, and I became
aware that there were things that happened to me during that summer I was
never going to tell my best friends, Thom Wright and Susan Reynolds, or my
new girlfriend, Deborah Schaffer. They would never know about the dreamy
afternoons swimming naked with our classmate Matt Kellner in Encino or
that my hand kept caressing Ryan Vaughn’s inner thigh in the Town &
Country triplex while we watched Escape from New York, floating on the
Valium I’d taken from one of my mother’s many prescription bottles; it was a
film I’d already seen—but I didn’t care because I just wanted to sit close to
Ryan in the darkness of the movie theater. My classmates would never know
that Matt Kellner blew me in the pool house he lived in behind his parents’
palatial estate on Haskell Avenue before I slid down and did the same to him,
or that Ryan Vaughn, co-captain of the varsity football team, hadn’t removed
my hand from his thigh in the darkened movie theater on an August night just
a few weeks ago.
2
AND RYAN VAUGHN was already standing by the pool in the Schaffers’
backyard holding a Corona when I arrived at Debbie’s house on that Sunday
night before Labor Day.
It was barely dusk and Ryan was backlit, a faint shadow, in front of the
glowing blue pool and the drifting pink sky, talking to Thom Wright and Jeff
Taylor, all of them wearing Polo shirts and pastel shorts, and somewhere Pat
Benatar was singing “We Live for Love”—it wasn’t loud, it was just coming
from the outdoor speakers, background noise that joined the kids hanging out
while Paul, the black butler who worked for the Schaffers, prepped burgers
and hot dogs and heated the grill in an alcove next to the pool house. A
variety of drinks (sodas, juices, iced tea, lemonade) had been set up on a table
next to where Paul was standing but there were also bottles of Corona in a
silver tub filled with ice that a few of the guys, including Thom and Jeff and
Ryan, had helped themselves to, and then Dominic Thompson, who I hadn’t
seen all summer—he’d been in Europe—joined them, also holding a Corona.
Pat Benatar became the Go-Go’s, and Beauty and the Beat started in its
entirety with “Our Lips Are Sealed” as I began making my way down the
stone steps that led to the pool area, where everyone had congregated—it was
an album we played all summer long in 1981 and knew by heart. Billie, the
Schaffers’ golden retriever, was wandering around, occasionally receiving a
distracted pet from one of the kids.
Pulling up to the circular driveway at the Schaffers’ mansion in Bel Air,
already lined with cars—I experienced a jolt when I saw Ryan’s black Trans
Am—I noted that Thom and Susan hadn’t waited for me when they arrived
just minutes before and I also knew that Debbie wasn’t back yet from the
stables in Malibu and that would give me enough time to talk to Ryan before
the distraction of her presence. The front door of the house was open and I
walked through the foyer beneath a massive chandelier and into the hallway
that led past the sunken living room, where I glimpsed Liz Schaffer, Debbie’s
mom, on the phone, in a loose-fitting robe, holding a glass that I presumed
was filled with vodka, and which she raised to me as I passed, smiling, and I
gave her a little wave back and then moved through the dining room and into
the kitchen and said hi to Maria, the Schaffers’ main housekeeper, and
grabbed a handful of tortilla chips where two of her associates were preparing
the rest of the food that night—fresh salsa, potato salad, coleslaw, corn on the
cob—while Steven Reinhardt, the Schaffers’ personal assistant, placed tubs
of Häagen-Dazs ice cream that had just been delivered into the walk-in
freezer. I passed through the open sliding glass doors and walked outside to
the vast backyard, which took me to the flagstone path that led down to the
pool area surrounded by eucalyptus and pine trees, and beyond that the tennis
court. Susan had already settled into a chaise longue, where she was talking
to Tracy Goldman and Katie Harris while Thom and Jeff stood next to her
nodding deeply to something Ryan was saying, the three of them standing
beneath a massive umbrella, its canopy a swirl of blue and yellow, and in the
background lit Tiki torches dotted the edges of the property as the Go-Go’s
played.
—
MY FIRST THOUGHT as I moved down the steps to the pool area was:
Why is Ryan here?
Well, my mind landed on, he’s a friend of Thom’s, and though Ryan
barely knows Susan, she’s Thom’s girlfriend, and Debbie Schaffer is Susan’s
best friend, and that’s why Ryan is here—it made sense, but I was nervous
seeing him, especially since this was only a small and exclusive group of
maybe fourteen, and Debbie, I’d noticed, had not invited anyone else, it
seemed, and though many of our classmates were still away on the final
vacation of the summer I’m sure there were many who weren’t and I
wondered what they thought about not being invited to Debbie’s Labor Day
Weekend barbecue—but this was how Debbie operated, on exclusivity, and
she enjoyed carefully choosing who she would invite, or not, to hang out
with, say, Billy Idol at Madame Wong’s or Duran Duran poolside at the
Hilton or Fleetwood Mac backstage at the Hollywood Bowl.
Ryan Vaughn and I may have known each other since seventh grade but
we’d only become close last May, when we started eating lunch together in
the courtyard of the Buckley Pavilion, for reasons that were never really clear
at first. Or maybe they were and we both ignored them, embarrassed. I had
always paid attention to Ryan since he was, I thought, beautiful in a gayfantasy way, a cartoon stud, and he was, like Thom, impossible not to pay
attention to because of this, but the problem I’d increasingly noticed with
Ryan throughout our high-school years was that, while Thom ingratiated
himself with everyone, Ryan was aloof and private, especially for someone
that good-looking and with the potential for the equivalence of Thom
Wright’s popularity, and at a certain point I began to understand why—it was
connected to how I felt. Ryan was me. We were the same. I realized Ryan
was, in fact, the closeted jock, the classic cliché that I doubt anyone would’ve
believed if I had confided it to them, or if I told everyone what was going to
be happening between Ryan and myself the first months of our senior year at
Buckley. We had gradually figured something out about each other.
This happened to occur, I believe, because we were driving cars and
mobile in ways we hadn’t been before, and this activated something;
possibilities were suddenly introduced to us, there were narratives we could
now create ourselves. Maybe it started with the glance Ryan and I had given
each other at the UCLA Mardi Gras in May of 1980, when we were both
sixteen—an idea that there was suddenly the promise of sex somewhere
within our teenage caution, and we had located each other, like secret agents,
without telling anyone, and there seemed to be certain opportunities that
neither one of us had admitted to until, finally, that past summer, in June,
when Ryan and I were driving around Westwood and he showed me a bruise
on his upper thigh he received playing soccer, and instead of hiking up the
shorts he was wearing he pulled one side down to show me the bruise, and
everything skipped; “Urgent” by Foreigner was pumping out of the radio
when I saw the pale skin, the muscled thigh, the taut ass cheek, the tuft of
hair that revealed itself at the top of his jockey shorts. It was a dare, of
course, and when we made eye contact there was a beat before we both
started laughing, and yes, it started in that theater in Encino when we saw
Escape from New York—we suddenly realized we were available. Though it
had actually begun before we saw the movie. He had come over to the house
on Mulholland to pick me up and there was no one home and I brought him
to my room. He was wearing white jeans and a pastel-blue Polo shirt with the
collar up and a pair of Vuarnets hung from a lanyard around his neck and his
blond hair was parted in the middle, cut short and feathered back. He eagerly
followed me down the deserted hallway to my bedroom, curious, but then he
realized something and stopped—I was coming on to him too quickly, we
had never discussed this before and he wasn’t prepared—and so he simply
said, somewhat haltingly, “I want to…but not just yet…not now.”
I was mildly surprised that Ryan, who seemed straight, had in fact finally
admitted he leaned toward my proclivities, but he came from a far more
conservative and middle-class home than other Buckley students, way out in
Northridge, and his family was vaguely religious. I had felt this connection
we distantly shared throughout our junior year, but it began to seem obvious
when we started eating lunch together in the Buckley courtyard near the end
of May, where there had suddenly been so much pointless flirtation, and now
Ryan had confirmed it. There was no suspicion about Ryan Vaughn among
our peers in the student body because Ryan was a dude, a bro, chill. He just
resembled a cool loner rather than someone secretly marginalized but I knew
that he was playing a game by lying low until he could get out of high school,
escape L.A., find a college far away and start over, reinventing himself, like
me. That was his plan. That was my plan. Since then Ryan and I had only
fooled around once—he had come over in mid-August to show me the new
Trans Am complete with a CB radio. No one was home at the house on
Mulholland and I finally pulled him onto my bed while we hungrily made out
and stripped naked. And though things were finally activated and I wanted to
take them further, as the summer ended Ryan went instead to Michigan,
visiting extended family until the first week of September, and I hadn’t seen
him since.
—
RYAN SAID SOMETHING TO THOM, motioned to where I was standing,
and Thom turned, and smiled at me, raised his Corona, a jock gesture. Ryan
said something else and clamped his hand on Thom’s shoulder and walked
away from him, leaving Thom to turn to Susan on the chaise, where she
ignored him a beat longer than she should have. I watched as Ryan neared
me, with what I imagined was a certain purposefulness, and I noted when he
placed his half-empty Corona bottle on a table he passed that this was a
signal he was leaving. Billie, the golden retriever, walked with him halfway
up the flagstone steps and then changed its mind and turned, to bound back to
the pool. Ryan came up to me, beautiful and blank-faced, no hint of emotion.
He raised his eyebrows.
“Hi,” I finally said, aiming for casual.
“Hi.” He smiled and it was real and relaxed in close-up.
“How was Michigan?” I asked, even though I didn’t care.
“You already asked me that,” he said. “Earlier. On the phone.”
“Oh. Yeah.”
“It was great,” he said, noncommittal. He was looking around the yard
and then directly at me. We were silent—we hadn’t seen each other since that
afternoon in my bedroom when we sucked each other off. And now it came
back—something got activated by his presence—lust rushed over me in an
instant. Ryan noted how I breathed in and then exhaled and realized what I
had just silently revealed, and laughed, staring straight at me.
“Easy there,” he said in a low voice.
“You’re leaving?” I asked, blushing.
“Yeah,” he said, glancing around the yard again. I waited.
“I wanted to see you but I don’t really want to hang out here,” he said.
“Why not?”
“Not my thing,” he said. “You know that.”
I wondered what that meant exactly but also somehow knew.
“Well, I don’t want to stay either—”
“I thought you were going to be home this afternoon,” he interrupted me.
“Didn’t I tell you I was going to the stables?” I asked, flustered.
“The stables?”
“To see Debbie’s new horse?”
“Um, no, I don’t remember you telling me that,” he said. “Her new
horse?” Another example of everything Ryan hated about this group.
“Yeah,” I said. “Out in Malibu.”
“No.” Ryan looked around as if continually distracted by something.
“Well—”
“Look, I’ve gotta go.”
“I’ll come with you—”
“No, no, just stay here, don’t follow me out, it’s cool.” He glanced over
my shoulder. Debbie was coming down the steps—she had changed clothes
since Windover, wearing a revealing Camp Beverly Hills T-shirt, and striped
Dolphin shorts—and she was barefoot, holding an unlit clove cigarette, her
hair pulled back with a headband. The smile Ryan offered Debbie was the
opposite of the one he’d greeted me with—it was the fake-genial Ryan,
straining for patience. I panicked that Ryan wasn’t taking what was
happening between us with the same seriousness I was and tried to tamp
down my frustration by pretending I didn’t care. The Go-Go’s were singing,
embarrassingly, “Lust to Love” and in that moment I was glad Debbie arrived
as a distraction.
“Hey, guys; hey, handsome,” Debbie said, giving each of us a hug. She
was slightly wired from the coke I was sure she’d just done—she had packets
of it everywhere and used it casually, as if she was popping caffeine pills.
“Are you leaving?” she asked Ryan with an exaggerated concern that I found
annoying. Debbie pushed into me, wrapping an arm around my waist, her
breast crushing against my chest—I hated this public display of affection in
front of Ryan but he barely glanced at that and then shrugged good-naturedly.
“Yeah, I’ve gotta go—just wanted to say hi.”
“Oh, don’t go, stick around,” Debbie whined. “Did you get something to
eat?”
“I’m fine, but thanks.”
“Come on, stay,” I said.
He made a tiny grimace that Debbie would never have noticed.
“Ryan’s leaving! Everybody say goodbye!” Debbie called out over the
Go-Go’s to the group at the pool even though I was positive she didn’t care.
I’m sure Ryan knew this as well. No one by the pool reacted.
“I already said goodbye to everyone,” Ryan explained.
I just stared at him, wanting him to stay but also thinking hopelessly:
what would the point be?
“I’ll see you guys Tuesday morning,” he said, making it clear, I realized,
that maybe we weren’t going to see each other tomorrow.
“Senior year, baby!” Debbie said.
“It’s gonna be great,” Ryan exclaimed—it sounded ironic, fake, but
Debbie couldn’t tell, suddenly preoccupied with her guests by the pool. “Go,
Griffins!” he added. This was manufactured as well—it was the name of the
Buckley mascot and the school’s sports teams and I knew he said it as a joke,
part of his performance. He clamped a hand on my shoulder just like he did
to Thom and gave it a squeeze that I invested more meaning in than there
might’ve actually been and then made his way up the stone steps leading
back to the house.
Debbie had taken my hand and pulled me down to where the group was.
I steeled myself not to look back at Ryan leaving, and I arrived at the pool in
a light daze and grabbed a Corona, which Paul opened for me, and then
started talking mindlessly to Thom and Kyle and Dominic—a lot of the
conversation was taken up with Debbie’s horse and the visit to the stables and
then Dominic’s European vacation and all the countries he traveled through
—our faces lit by the pool and the wavering Tiki torches, the Go-Go’s
singing around us. Susan smiled dreamily up at me from where she reclined
on the chaise, and gestured at the house—“Why did he leave?” she mouthed.
I shrugged, and turned back to the guys. Why had she asked me that? I
suddenly wondered. What did she know about Ryan Vaughn and me?
—
STEVEN came down to the pool area and started taking photos at Debbie’s
request. No one really posed—because we were already posing, I thought to
myself as twilight softly descended; we just glanced over at him and smiled
as he quickly took inventory, trying to capture everyone—it was a job
ordered by his boss’s daughter, not something he might have wanted to do—
and Debbie conferred with Paul at the grill, ordering the butler around as she
usually did, which he took with a geniality that always relieved me, and
Maria was laying out the side salads and the condiments for the burgers, and
soon everyone made a plate and sat in a loose, makeshift circle on three of
the chaise longues and as the night darkened and the Tiki torches dimmed the
pool became brighter and was the only source lighting our faces. At one point
I smelled marijuana and looked around: Terry Schaffer had lit a joint while
lying on a chaise longue across the pool, near the bar, away from the kids.
I hadn’t noticed him, which was strange because Terry was fond of
making some kind of awkward pass at either Thom or Jeff or myself, usually
in the way of a joke, whenever we were at the house on Stone Canyon—this
started, I noticed, once we’d turned sixteen, and found ourselves hanging out
at the Schaffers’ with a new regularity simply because Debbie had the nicest
backyard and threw the most parties, second only to Anthony Matthews, and
Terry would sidle up to the boys and ask if we’d like to go swimming, even if
it was a gathering that didn’t involve the pool—we could always borrow one
of his bathing suits, he’d insist, or you could just go au naturel if we felt
comfortable about that, he was cool with it—he was somewhat stoned when
he suggested this and we always declined. I don’t know what Thom or Jeff
felt (mild annoyance or sheer cluelessness, I imagined) but I had no problem
with Terry lightly flirting with me because it wasn’t going anywhere—he was
over twice my age and he was Debbie’s father (of all people) and nothing
was going to happen, and yet by a certain point that past summer I became
flattered by his attention and never felt threatened.
That night Terry was wearing Polo shorts and a black T-shirt with the
logo of Thief, a recent Michael Mann movie that had done okay but less
business than was expected when released in March, and though it was night
he was wearing Porsche Carrera sunglasses, whose lenses were mirrored by
the pool’s blue water, and I knew he was watching one of us, either Thom or
myself, or maybe Jeff, but I’d noticed that Terry had been singling me out
that summer—the summer I became Debbie’s boyfriend—whenever a group
of us was over, probably because he’d figured out finally that Thom Wright
wasn’t available, and neither was Jeff Taylor (unless Terry wanted to dole out
some cash whenever Jeff’s erratic, alcoholic dad cut him off—if Ron Levin
wasn’t around who knew what Jeff was up for), and yet why did Terry
assume that I was available, even though I was the one dating Debbie? How
had he guessed this about his daughter’s boyfriend? What clues had I
offered? I’d never defined myself as gay but how did Terry know I could lean
toward that? And yet, I wondered, how had I known about Ryan Vaughn
during our junior year? I imagined it was just the distant signal that secret
agents responded to as I watched Billie sidle up to the chaise longue and
nestle below Terry.
—
DEBBIE WAS TALKING nonstop while smoking the clove cigarette—she
hadn’t eaten anything—and it all sounded like nonsense revolving around the
upcoming senior year and how awesome and rad it was going to be,
something a PR person would come up with: Homecoming in October—she
already had ideas for the class float—and the senior prom, not until May,
already being organized and with, of course, Susan and Thom fated for
Queen and King, to be held at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the after party on
Dominic Thompson’s father’s yacht, and all of this had been eagerly set into
motion, including the senior Christmas party, the yearbook Debbie would be
co-editing, with the new inclusion of the “Hottest Teachers” page, Grad Nite
was scheduled for Disneyland, and there would be a private party for Buckley
and Harvard and Westlake students in the Blue Bayou restaurant inside the
Pirates of the Caribbean where Tommy Tutone would be performing—
Debbie had already booked them. At some point I zoned out and when I
refocused noticed a few people had left and it was just the core group of
Thom, Susan, Debbie along with Jeff Taylor and Tracy Goldman, who I
guess were dating by that time though nothing had been confirmed. Terry
was stoned on the chaise across the pool, immobile, maybe even sleeping,
and the Go-Go’s record repeated itself but the volume had been lowered and I
remember that “This Town” was playing (…Bet you’d live here if you could
and be one of us…) as Debbie continued with her litany of events when
Susan suddenly announced as if she just remembered it: “There’s a new guy.”
“What?” Debbie asked, distracted by the interruption.
“A new guy is coming in on Tuesday,” Susan said.
There was stillness, brief and surprised, until someone asked, “What do
you mean?”
“Yeah,” I said. “A new guy?”
Susan said, “I mean we have a new addition to the senior class. There’s a
new kid in the senior class.”
“Really? That’s a little weird,” Debbie said.
“Who is it?” Jeff asked, concerned.
“Yeah,” Tracy chimed in. “What’s his name?”
“Robert Mallory,” Susan said.
This was the first time any of us heard the name. The name didn’t
register. But because of what happened later I will always remember that
moment. The moment his name came out of her mouth. The first time it was
uttered. The moment he came alive.
Robert Mallory.
“Do you know anything about him?” I asked.
Susan shrugged. “No. He has a Century City address. He lives in one of
the Century Towers.”
“That’s strange,” Jeff murmured. “You never get a new kid senior year.”
“Do you know where he comes from?” Debbie asked. “Who his parents
are?”
Dr. Croft told Susan that Robert Mallory hadn’t been an L.A. resident
but was coming in from Chicago. The conversation she had with Croft, which
dealt with her duties this year as student-body president and what she would
be saying when she addressed the school on Tuesday at the morning
assembly, was fast and hazy and she couldn’t remember if Robert Mallory
was living with an aunt or a guardian or a stepmother. (There were other
details Dr. Croft had told her about Robert Mallory that Susan wouldn’t
confess to us until later.) “I really wasn’t paying attention,” Susan admitted,
glancing over at Thom, who was now lying next to her on the chaise she’d
been occupying all evening, the two of them pressed together, squeezing in,
accommodating themselves to the size of the chaise; all she got was that
Croft confirmed Robert Mallory would be on campus Tuesday.
We might have been surprised by this anomaly but none of us thought it
was particularly unusual. It was rare to change schools your senior year but
the privilege of Buckley and the overall L.A. private-school world in that
moment was exploited by parents with the means to move their kids around
based on their own needs or scheduling or convenience, and obviously
Robert Mallory’s parents needed him in a new place, this one in L.A. for
some reason, in order to graduate, and not in Boston or Philadelphia or
Chicago, or wherever he was actually from, and his parents, or guardians, or
whoever, had decided to land him at Buckley. Nineteen eighty-one was a
time before private schools in L.A. had waiting lists thousands of names long
and parents lost their minds trying to get their children onto those lists let
alone into the schools themselves, and in 1981 if you could afford the tuition
you basically got your kid in anywhere—there was no competition for any of
the open slots that were available, no testing, no belabored meetings with
staff, no gifts; if you could write the check to cover tuition you were in.
That’s how it worked.
And yet it flashed across my mind that night, unbidden—and I don’t
know why this suspicion arose—if Robert Mallory was living in Century City
he would have been eligible to attend Beverly Hills High because he lived
within the appropriate district and there was the added incentive that there
was no tuition because it was public, and I suddenly wondered, why hadn’t
Robert Mallory opted for that? I didn’t say anything, because it didn’t seem
warranted and I was ready to leave the Schaffers’ because I needed to drive
around the city and listen to sad music and smoke cigarettes while thinking
about Ryan. I noticed that Thom and Susan were sharing a bowl of
strawberry ice cream and that Thom was the only one who seemed to have no
interest in the dwindling conversation about the new student—his green eyes
just stared lazily into the lit pool, a smear of pink cream on his upper lip, his
brown hair combed back from his tan forehead and lightly feathered, and I
noticed he still hadn’t finished the Corona I first saw him with when I
arrived. I had finished three.
“Well, he better be cute,” Debbie said. I wanted to say “I agree” but
didn’t.
Despite the chill of disappointment I felt about Ryan leaving the
Schaffers’ earlier I can now attest that Sunday in September was one of the
last nights, if not the last night, I was ever fully happy and there was no fear.
—
“I HAVE TO GO, GUYS,” I said, standing up. It seemed no one else was
leaving and I realized it was early, only eight o’clock, and I’d forgotten that
everyone was staying to watch a new movie in the screening room
—Continental Divide, a romantic comedy starring John Belushi and Blair
Brown, that would be released later in September and that I wouldn’t have
been able to concentrate on that night, not only because I simply didn’t want
to be there any longer but because thoughts of Ryan were everywhere,
distracting me. After a few muffled halfhearted complaints from Thom and
Susan I said good night to everyone, except for Terry, who was comatose on
the chaise, and let Debbie walk me out to my car. But when she reached the
top of the stone steps, Debbie silently redirected me to the back staircase that
led up to her bedroom without having to go through the house and I only
resisted once—I said I was tired and needed to get home. She knew that
wasn’t true or just didn’t care—she often mistook me for someone hard to
get, a tease, a boy who enjoyed playing a game, a boy who was a challenge,
and I let her: she liked being in charge.
The screening was about to start and things happened quickly: once in
the darkness of her room I was pushed onto the bed and Debbie slipped off
her Dolphins and the pink panties she was wearing and immediately straddled
my waist, leaning over me, her plush lips pressing against mine while she
fumbled with the zipper on my tennis shorts. I lifted my hips so she could
pull them down mid-thigh along with my underwear but I wasn’t even half
hard. And yet Debbie seemed high, voracious, and after uselessly sucking my
dick she guided my hand to her pussy, already slick and wet, and she pushed
my fingers into it with her own hand. I still wasn’t hard but in that moment I
don’t think Debbie cared—she simply rolled onto her back, her legs spread,
and lifted the Camp Beverly Hills T-shirt, urging me toward her breasts. I
remember she smelled of rose oil that night as I sucked her stiffening nipples
while she kept guiding my hand along her clit, strumming it, her legs spread
as wide as possible, the vulva open and hot, and she would push my hand
there, which I would finger roughly before she moved it back to her clitoris.
Her breasts were big and perfectly formed and I ran my mouth over them,
clamping down on her nipples, which were small and pink and wet with my
saliva and now totally stiff. She reached for my cock but it was only semihard and even if I’d been able to get an erection it would have been
impossible to maintain because everyone was now passing outside Debbie’s
room below us and I could hear their voices through the window as the group
made its way up the stone steps into the house, and this distraction was
stressing me out. But Debbie always came fast, within minutes she could
thrash out an orgasm, it took barely anything to make her come, and this was
happening now. I kept hearing the group moving from the pool up the steps
to the house, voices fading and then reappearing, muffled and directly below
us in the screening room, where I heard Steven announcing the movie—he
was the projectionist. Debbie convulsed, her mouth on mine, and quietly
came, whimpering.
And then she asked, panting: “Are you okay?”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” I assured her, sitting up.
The phone by her bed—pink, rotary, next to a copy of The Beverly Hills
Diet—rang and she immediately answered. “Hello?” She listened. “Okay,
Steven, I’ll be right down.” She cocked her head. “No, I think he’s still by the
pool.” Pause. “Yeah, okay.” She looked at me. “No, he’s here in my
bedroom.” She hung up and without looking over, said, “The movie’s
starting. Sure you don’t want to stay?”
“No,” I said. “I should probably go.”
“You’re silly,” she said.
She leaned over and turned on the lamp by the bed, revealing the coralcolored room, which was massive, one wall a series of shelves lined with
trophies and plaques and ribbons and photos—all from her participation in
equestrian sports the last five years. Another wall was covered with recent
posters of new bands whose members Debbie had partied with; a reminder
she was a rich groupie from Beverly Hills and seventeen, sexy and
sophisticated and just jaded enough to locate and gain access anywhere she
wanted. My hand was so wet it glistened as if it had been brushed with oil,
and Debbie stumbled off to the bathroom, which was almost as spacious as
her bedroom, and closed the door. I heard water running while I grabbed a
couple of Kleenex and wiped my hand off, then stood and hiked up my
underwear and tennis shorts.
Debbie hurriedly walked out of the bathroom—she had slipped on a pair
of light cotton sweatpants, also Camp Beverly Hills, and was holding a small
plastic packet and quickly did two bumps, then offered it to me. I shook my
head no. She shrugged. “I’ll see you later, babe,” she said. “Movie’s
starting.”
“Okay,” I said. “See you Tuesday.”
“Not tomorrow?”
“No,” I said. “I’ve got to…get ready for, um, school.”
We both paused, silently noting how strange that sounded coming from a
seventeen-year-old man.
“Okay, whatever. You’re lame.” She rolled her eyes—she didn’t have
time to argue. She kissed me on the lips and then hurried out of the room, this
time through the door that took her into the main house and downstairs to the
theater.
—
I FOLLOWED Debbie down the grand curving staircase that led to the foyer
until she darted down a hallway where I could hear the movie starting behind
the closed doors of the screening room in the silent house. I paused, lingering
at the foot of the staircase, reached into my pocket, touching the car keys, and
was walking toward the front door when I heard someone call my name. The
voice was coming from the living room, adjacent to the foyer, and I steeled
myself. It was precise as well as sounding alarmed, as if I’d surprised the
voice somehow. I knew who it was; I’d been through this before. I moved
slowly toward the entrance to the living room, where Liz Schaffer was sitting
in a floral-patterned armchair, hunched over, elbows on her knees, one hand
holding the same glass I saw her with earlier—but she looked disheveled
now, something had happened in the last couple of hours since I’d first seen
her and she had innocently waved to me while on the phone. Liz Schaffer had
been a fairly beautiful woman—in 1981 she was only in her late thirties, and
a famous model in her teens and early twenties, before she married Terry, but
her face tonight was decidedly older and flushed, frozen into a kind of
stunned grimace, and the Bijan robe Liz wore was half open and her breasts
were visible. Next to her was a white baby-grand piano and a vase filled with
an arrangement of flowers so formidable they reached to the living room’s
beamed ceiling. I just stood there, not knowing what to do while she kept
squinting at me even though all the lights in the living room and the foyer
were on—but it seemed in that brief period of time she’d forgotten what
name she called out. And then she remembered and seemed disappointed.
“You’re not staying for the movie, Bret?” Liz asked with mock
incredulity, as if my exit was offending her.
“I have to go.” I smiled tightly and motioned to the front door. “No, I’m
not staying for the movie.”
“Where? Where would you have to go?” She stared at me, hunched over,
motionless.
“I just…have to be going,” I said, gesturing to the door again, and then
as if speaking to a child: “Are you going to watch the movie, Liz?”
“Where’s my husband?” she asked, sitting up. Liz wasn’t a sloppy drunk
exactly—when she drank she seemed too angry to topple over or pass out and
she never slurred her words. Everything she said was enunciated with a high
level of disdain: in fact she always adopted a light British accent in an
attempt to suggest control and aristocratic normalcy. When she realized that
I’d just asked her something, she answered with an exaggerated sneer, “No, I
am not going to watch the movie, Bret.”
I aimed for being the polite guest, her daughter’s gracious boyfriend, and
gently started backing away and said, “Okay, well, I hope you have a, um,
good night, Liz, and I’ll see you soon—”
“Don’t walk away from me,” she said, glaring.
I stood still, and very carefully, maintaining my pose, said, “Liz, I think
you’re tired.”
She tried to stand up, staggering against the armchair. I almost made a
move to help but thought it might piss her off so I remained where I was. Any
sudden gestures could ratchet up her anger. Or she might make a pass, a
drunken sexual overture; it had happened before.
“Don’t condescend to me,” Liz said, gripping the side of the armchair
and steadying herself, the robe now draping open and revealing she wasn’t
wearing underwear. “I’ve known you since you were ten years old, Bret. Do
not condescend to me.” Her eyes were closed and she was shaking her head.
“I’m sorry, Liz, I really have to go—”
“Where is my fucking husband?” she said, abruptly. She opened her
eyes. They landed on me.
“I think he’s down by the pool,” I said.
“Down by the pool?” she said, confused. “Down. By. The. Pool?”
There was movement to my left—a figure was in the hall. It was Steven.
I looked over at him as he made his way toward the living room: mid-forties,
frizzy-haired, wild-eyed, a failed screenwriter, now working as an all-around
assistant for the Schaffers. I barely knew him even though he’d been with
them since 1977—he was their chauffeur, their secretary, often Terry’s
traveling partner on business, and lived in a guesthouse adjacent to the
mansion. I knew Steven was straight and had girlfriends, so there was
nothing going on between him and Terry, and besides he was nowhere near
what I found out to be Terry’s type. I’d always thought Steven was a weirdo
and maintained my distance but I was relieved to see him that night.
“With who is my husband with?” Liz balanced herself against the chair.
She now pretended to be legitimately intrigued but she was also vaguely
threatening. “I’m surprised he’s not down there with all you boys—”
It stung whenever Liz referenced Terry’s gayness—I was always
embarrassed and never said anything. I never wanted to engage her further in
order to confirm it. “I have to go,” I said. “Steven’s coming to help you.”
“Where are you going, Bret?” Liz asked, trying to walk forward. “Are
you going back to the pool? Are you going to see my faggot husband down
by the pool?”
“Hey, you can go, Bret,” Steven said to me, and then, under his breath, “I
can handle it.”
“You know my husband is a faggot, right?” Liz was saying this
genuinely, calmly.
“Hey, Liz,” Steven said, bounding down the steps into the living room.
“How you doing?”
“Bret is just leaving,” she said with a theatrical flourish. “He told me that
my husband is down by the pool. Whatever that means. Is this true, Steven?”
Steven took the glass from her hand while she stared into his face with a
pleading expression even though the anger was still pulsing beneath it.
“I think he is,” Steven said, and in a series of graceful movements placed
the glass down, slid his arm through hers and started moving Liz gently
through the living room.
I turned toward the front door. Liz noticed and called out in a scolding
tone: “Don’t you walk away from me. I’ve known you since you were ten
years old. Don’t you dare walk away from me, Bret—”
I glanced back. She was trying to wrestle out of Steven’s grip but he just
kept moving her through the living room in tiny baby steps.
“We’re going to bed now, Liz,” Steven was saying. “Okay? I’m taking
you upstairs now…”
Steven nodded, indicating he had the situation under control and that I
should leave. The last sound I heard was Liz weeping with Steven trying to
console her as I closed the front door behind me.
—
TOTAL SILENCE IN BEL AIR automatically reminded me of sanity,
competing with the loud and absurd complications within the Schaffers’
mock–French Tudor mansion, and I realized again that I was moving away
from Debbie and Liz and Terry and all the useless friends I’d be abandoning
in less than a year. Even though it was only eight-thirty I was exhausted but
didn’t want to go home—something was pushing me, I felt driven, it was
vague and uneasy, a hunger; I wanted to stay awake and wished I’d taken a
packet of Debbie’s cocaine but I didn’t want to go back into the house. In
retrospect, this was a fairly typical night at the Schaffers’ except for one
small detail. The name of a boy, a stranger, a mysterious new student, had
now been dropped into the narrative, and it had become a distraction for me.
Robert Mallory. And then I was startled by Billie barking somewhere in the
vastness of the backyard. I was in the driveway, leaning against the
Mercedes, sorting through my options, when I looked up at the house as I
turned to get into the car. And I noticed a figure, half in shadow, staring
down at me from a second-story diamond-patterned window—this would
have been at the landing where the staircase began. I thought for a moment it
was Terry, finally mobile and heading to bed, to join Liz, who I hoped had
already passed out. But it was, in fact, Steven Reinhardt, Terry’s assistant,
staring down at me.
Startled, I held up a hand, a gesture, barely a wave. For a moment it
seemed as if he hadn’t registered the wave, and this creeped me out, a
reminder of how weird I always thought Steven was. But as if a cue was
given, he suddenly remembered his part, and lifted his arm and raised a hand
—he was an alien or a robot greeting someone he’d never met before. I stared
up at the window—I could barely see him, just make out the frizzy head of
hair, the slight build encased in a turtleneck he always wore, the blinding
lights of the chandelier behind him, the shadow of the fern he stood next to.
But then I realized he was holding a camera and had raised it: he was taking
my picture. This pushed me to get into the car and pull out of the driveway
and once I drove through Bel Air’s East Gate I made a left onto an empty
Sunset Boulevard and decided to bypass Beverly Glen, which would have
taken me back to the house on Mulholland, and instead headed toward
Hollywood, where I’d return to the Valley from the freeways there.

BUT THERE WAS A DISTRACTION, a flaw in the paradisaical canvas of
the summer of 1981: the disappearance of a girl leaving a party on the
outskirts of Encino in late July.
There was very little reported about the disappearance at first and none
of us knew her—she might have stayed a rumor or what would later be
known as an urban myth, teenage girl disappears from party never to be seen
again—but she was soon connected to two other cases, one from the summer
of 1980 and another in January of 1981, and after Julie Selwyn’s body was
discovered at the end of September, it was revealed that the victims
resembled each other and there were details about their deaths that connected
them as well. In 1981 no one knew what had happened specifically to Julie
Selwyn or Katherine Latchford or Sarah Johnson, or that the same person or
persons had killed them—just that they had been abducted and were missing
for two months with Katherine’s and Sarah’s bodies discovered in remote
locations, called in by what investigators assumed was the killer in a fake
groaning drawl, who wanted to know why the girls, dumped weeks earlier,
hadn’t been discovered yet—he was waiting for his work to be admired. The
matching mutilations that the victims suffered were not fully revealed to the
press and it was almost a year after the last girl was found at the end of 1981
until most of these details were ultimately known—in a pre-digital world
secrets were more easily kept; in fact, secrets were the norm in a pre-digital
world. Before any confirmation was made there were only rumors concerning
the specificity of the mutilations and how the girls had been tortured and
killed. However, there were leaks, anonymous sources verified, containing
details so obscene that if you believed them you quickly realized why the Los
Angeles Police Department kept the details of what they called “the injuries”
as vague as they did. Because those who knew exactly about them—had
perhaps seen the wounds during the autopsy beneath the fluorescent lights in
the morgue—didn’t want the populace to become overly frightened.
—
THE PUBLIC DIDN’T KNOW this yet but Julie Selwyn would be the third
victim of a serial killer who came to be known as the Trawler—this was a
nickname that two investigators in the Hollywood division of the LAPD
jokingly came up with in private. It was a lewd joke that involved fishing
methods, operating a net, the storage of fish, what had supposedly been done
to the girl’s vaginas, the contents of Katherine Latchford’s own aquarium
had been missing a week before she was abducted and found sewn into hers
—though it was actually rubber cement that the killer used—which meant
that Katherine Latchford had been targeted weeks before she was abducted.
“The Trawler” was a dumb name—it came nowhere near defining the totality
of the killer’s madness—but a memo had been leaked to the press, and in one
line that hadn’t been redacted “The Trawler” was clearly referenced and
became the name of this nascent serial killer in the few articles that appeared:
it hit the right ominous note. But in the summer of 1981 the Trawler had not
officially been named yet—the victims were just beginning to become
connected and the series of articles in the Los Angeles Times confirming this
wouldn’t appear until late September. No one knew yet that Julie Selwyn
would be the third victim of a serial killer that had been operating in L.A.
County since the summer of 1980 when Katherine Latchford disappeared
mid-June. It wasn’t until the third week of our senior year that the Trawler
would be named, introduced to us and emerge as a character in the city’s
narrative.
—
WHEN I LOOK BACK AT 1980 AND INTO the fall of 1981 we didn’t
think we knew anything about the Trawler yet: meaning we didn’t know his
name or how he got his name, we didn’t know what his history was and we
didn’t know he was about to thrive and kill three more people that autumn in
L.A., one of whom we knew. But beginning in the summer of 1980 there
were a number of signs, of clues, that were an actual and legitimate part of
what became the Trawler’s pattern, the narrative he was building, the story he
wanted to tell, that we did know about. Later on it was confirmed that there
were explicit warning signs if the Trawler had actually targeted someone but
in the early days no one knew any of this yet: the connections hadn’t been
made.
Beginning in the late spring of 1980 a series of home invasions started
announcing themselves in the hills above the San Fernando Valley. There
was no pattern—young couples, old couples, a single male screenwriter, a
woman who lived alone, families where there were teenage girls as well as
teenage boys—and though girls ultimately became the preferred victims of
the Trawler, initially boys were attacked during these home invasions as well
and one boy was later killed by him. The home invasions that we knew of
and read about in the spring and into the summer and early fall of 1980
seemed totally random: since no specific type was attacked—gender and age
seemed irrelevant, it was girls and it was boys—there was really nowhere to
hide, no way to protect yourself against this person who was committing the
home invasions, everyone was vulnerable. People began to finally piece
together that one of the clues connected to the Trawler (again, not named yet)
had to do with animals. The Trawler focused on someone whose family had
pets or the victim had a pet themselves (and it didn’t matter if it was a dog, a
cat, a bird, a snake in one instance, mice, a rabbit, a guinea pig) and the pet
would disappear, and not only the victim’s pet, but other pets in the
neighborhood where the victim resided would vanish as well in advance of
the home invasion when the victim was attacked. Before he committed his
assaults often three animals, in the same neighborhood, would ultimately be
sacrificed by the Trawler, and it wasn’t until the late fall of 1981 that we
learned what the reason was—what he ultimately did with their carcasses and
why he needed them.
—
THE HOME INVASIONS began in May of 1980, when it seemed the
Trawler was simply testing things out. The Trawler at this point didn’t enter
properties and remained shrouded, his presence announced only in the
clichéd language of horror movies: someone remembered hearing the wind
chimes hanging over the veranda in a house on Oakfield Drive in Sherman
Oaks even though there wasn’t the slightest breeze on that June night, or
there was the shaky beam of a flashlight someone on Woodcliff Road
reported in mid-July, held by a figure clad in black who was standing on the
deck beside the pool, and in his other fist was the glint of a butcher knife.
During the summer of 1980, a time when the Trawler hadn’t been named and
hadn’t killed anyone yet (Katherine Latchford disappeared mid-June but her
body wasn’t found until two months later), there were increasing reports of
an actual intruder and the witnesses who supplied descriptions of this person
were vague because of the black ski mask and the matching jeans and
turtleneck he wore: he was tall, he wasn’t that tall, he was lean, he was built,
he was heavy, he had “wild” and “violet” eyes, no one had seen his eyes, they
were a piercing blue, they were hazel. Whoever played this character was
extremely elusive—a shape-shifter—though he was responsible for twenty
break-ins that summer alone in the homes on the San Fernando Valley side
below Mulholland, very close to where I lived, and stretching from Studio
City through Sherman Oaks and into Encino, and then briefly into Bel Air
and Benedict Canyon, and then the home invasions became scattered
(Pasadena, Glendale, Hollywood), and then abruptly stopped.
They didn’t start up again until mid-December where they continued
throughout January of 1981. No one had any idea at the time when Katherine
Latchford’s body was found in August of 1980 that she was connected to the
home invasions that had plagued the city, or that it was connected to the
disappearing pets and the actual assaults. Later we would find out that phone
calls were often made to a targeted home where the next victim resided days
before the attack, coming from phone booths lining Ventura Boulevard or
Burbank or Reseda, or across the canyons on Sunset and into Hollywood,
almost as if the calls confirmed something for the Trawler—the victim would
pick up, ask who was there, the Trawler would say nothing, just listen as the
confusion morphed into annoyance, and then fear. Later there would be other
clues usually offered when one of the victims’ memory would kick back in:
someone, it seemed, had entered the house previously, before the night of the
attack, something about the kitchen or the contents in a bathroom or the
bedroom was “different,” leading investigators to believe that the Trawler
had familiarized himself with the residence in the days before the assault.
Later someone noted that Katherine Latchford—the first of the murder
victims, the pretty girl with feathered hair and full lips and sleepy eyes that
were half closed in the yearbook photo that became famous—complained
that her cat had disappeared in the days before she vanished, and
unbeknownst to her two dogs from the neighborhood were missing as well.
Katherine had also told her parents that she’d been receiving “strange” phone
calls in the days leading up to her disappearance—they weren’t obscene but
in a way they were worse because of the silence: you had no idea what the
person on the other line wanted. It seemed there were limitless possibilities
that your frightened mind conjured.
—
ULTIMATELY, IT WAS NOTED, there was something methodical and
patterned about the Trawler’s attacks—they were so carefully pre-assembled
that a plan was suggested, an actual narrative, something being consciously
created; they weren’t random or impulsive at all. There was, in fact, an ornate
staginess about them. At first it seemed that the attacks were created by
someone who was ambivalent, and this was confirmed when certain victims
involved in the first wave of invasions during the spring and early summer of
1980 admitted something that didn’t line up necessarily with a person who
had broken into your home and assaulted you. The victims who survived
these initial attacks, the ones in May and early June, before Katherine
Latchford was abducted—people who had been roped and bound, prone on
their bedroom and living-room floors, sometimes stripped by the figure clad
in black and wearing the overlarge ski mask—said that whoever had attacked
them was “weeping” when he left the residence after he had apparently been
sated: a few of the attacks were sexual in nature but most were not. When the
first murder happened, and the home invasions and the assaults picked up in
mid-December after the long lull of a three-month hiatus, many people who
survived the next wave of invasions commented that the attacker hadn’t cried
at all; it was almost as if he had gained confidence, a strength, and perhaps by
committing his first murder had become emboldened.
—
THE LEAD-UP TO THE Trawler’s first victim became the elaborate
template: the disappearing pets, the phone calls, the rehearsal break-in—but
not an assault. This was true of the second victim as well: Sarah Johnson
abducted behind the Tower Records on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks
in early January of 1981. Her body was discovered eight weeks later in a
drainpipe at an abandoned construction site on the outskirts of Simi Valley;
her cat had disappeared, she complained to her mother that the furniture in
her bedroom had been rearranged, and someone was calling her, breathing
into the phone, not obscene exactly, just unnerving but she was never
assaulted in a home invasion. Sarah had left a party in Tarzana and drove to
pick up a cassette on the way back to her parents’ home in Studio City but
she never made it into the Tower Records on Ventura Boulevard and her
remains wouldn’t be discovered until the first week in March, found in the
same condition and with the same “injuries” as Julie Selwyn had suffered
when she was found in September of 1981, rotting on a public tennis court in
a park near Woodland Hills; she had been propped up and splayed against the
net, her head just a skull with flesh stretched over it but with a full head of
hair and empty sockets where her eyes had been gouged out, and what had
been inflicted upon the rest of her body—what the hideous mutilations
represented—we wouldn’t find out until the end of the year when the details
were finally revealed in a long article in the Los Angeles Times, having only
been previously alluded to because of the grotesque and upsetting nature of
the injuries.
—
I HAD MOMENTS WHEN I was afraid of whoever was committing the
home invasions and that the house on Mulholland might be its next target but
for some reason I thought my odds were okay as a lucky seventeen-year-old
—there were so many things I was preoccupied with, and the home invasions
never really got covered in the way they would have if everyone knew what
the Trawler was ultimately capable of: they never set off a mass wave of
panic. It seemed my only point of reference in the summer of 1980, when the
Trawler began announcing itself, was trying to figure out Matt Kellner. What
had become a mild sexual obsession with a classmate distracted me for about
a year, until I realized that Ryan Vaughn was going to eclipse Matt. And on
that Labor Day Monday I woke up late in the empty house on Mulholland
thinking about Matt as I usually did, even though Ryan was beginning to
crowd my thoughts, replacing not only Matt but also Thom Wright and Susan
Reynolds in my dreams and fantasies.
—
MY PARENTS WOULD BE AWAY most of the fall, traveling through
Europe on a number of cruises trying to repair their flailing marriage after
numerous separations and I had zero interest in the outcome—divorce was
preferable to the agonies that the marriage played out, and it became
increasingly apparent as I moved through my adolescence that I wasn’t
particularly close to either my mother or my father. We were all distant from
each other even though the public façade, the Boomer narrative, suggested
otherwise: the Christmas card with the posed family photo emblazoned on it,
the sleepovers I had where my mother acted like a concerned chaperone
checking in on us as we watched the Z Channel, the days at the beach club
with Thom and Jeff and Kyle that my father oversaw and where he acted as if
he was our best friend—all of it seemed fake, performative, unreal. There
was no doubt my parents loved me and if pressed I would admit I loved them
back but I was becoming an autonomous adult and realized that I didn’t need
them in the ways I once had.
And alone in the house on Mulholland that fall I felt even more like an
adult because I had the entire place to myself, even though my bedroom—
huge with a sweeping view of the San Fernando Valley—was its own selfsustaining home I almost solely resided in: I had a separate entrance with a
veranda that led out to the pool, and a kitchenette with a refrigerator filled
with ginger ale and Perrier, a massive bathroom with its own separate shower
and tub, and my room was situated close enough to the garage so that I barely
spent any time in the rest of the house. Our Nicaraguan maid, Rosa, was off
Labor Day weekend and wouldn’t be back until the following Tuesday.
Though my parents would be away for twelve weeks my mother wanted Rosa
to stick to her schedule anyway—she confided in me when I complained and
insisted I could look after myself that Rosa needed the money. Her job while
my parents were gone was to basically look after the only child, the
privileged son, and make sure the kitchen and my bedroom were kept clean,
to wash my towels and launder my sheets, to let in the gardener and the pool
boy and the landscape designer my mother had recently hired. Rosa was there
to collect the mail, attend to the shopping, prepare my meals, and make sure
Shingy—my mom’s dog, a Lhasa Apso–mutt mix—was washed and
groomed every two weeks while my parents floated across Europe. I would
be updated on their location with rambling messages left always by my
mother on my answering machine.
With Rosa gone on that Labor Day it was my job to make sure Shingy
was fed and let out onto the lawn adjacent to the pool in the yard,
overlooking the Valley where it dropped onto a hillside lined with eucalyptus
and jacaranda trees, while I idly sat in the Jacuzzi and watched the dog sniff
around, keeping an eye on him because of coyotes and where I could faintly
hear the occasional sound of a car passing behind the huge boxwood hedge
that separated our property from Mulholland Drive. I ushered Shingy back
inside, where I debated calling Ryan Vaughn but decided he would perceive
this as too needy and called Matt Kellner instead, but no one picked up—he
didn’t have an answering machine—and so I drove down to Encino, where
Matt would be high by the pool, and I remember I didn’t masturbate that day
because I was sure something would happen with Matt and so before I left I
reread pages I’d typed of the novel I was working on while smoking clove
cigarettes and listening to Elvis Costello until I got bored and then sped
through a third of the new Stephen King, Cujo, which had just been published
that August.
—
MATT KELLNER WAS A TALL, GREEN-EYED JEWISH guy with a
killer body who was also the class stoner and I, at one point in the fall of
1980, had come to believe that he would’ve had sex with anybody, boy or
girl, if they made themselves available to him in the ways that I did, but no
one at Buckley seemed to have found Matt Kellner as intriguing. Part of the
reason had to do with the fact that Matt was always too distant, lost in his
own world, you could never reach him, he was far away from everyone, it
almost seemed as if he’d been wounded by something so profound (though
he never revealed what it was) that it altered the way he dealt with people. I’d
been watching Matt since he arrived at Buckley in seventh grade, and though
he should’ve been popular he was simply too weird—if he had just acted
vaguely “normal” he could have been a star because of how physically hot he
was but instead he became a kind of outcast, an increasingly fumbling and
awkward dude, a parody of a privileged young Valley stoner, and no one was
interested. But I grew to like him and his pothead amiability and it was also
the gray Buckley slacks worn just a little too tight, overaccentuating his ass,
and a noticeably visible bulge, that became so distracting to me as we got
older. Matt seemed to have no capability for basic socializing, and at first I
wasn’t sure if this was because of how stoned he was all the time or if he was
just inherently shy, but I soon realized that he simply didn’t care about the
social contract we had all bought into—he didn’t even seem aware of his
surroundings—and there was something rebellious and almost punk about
this stance even though it wasn’t conscious: he simply didn’t care about how
things worked; in fact he seemed defiantly un-self-conscious. I noted how he
would walk naked through the locker room, from the bench where he took his
sweat-soaked clothes off after running track, to the showers, and back again,
just naked, drying himself off completely unaware, shamelessly, and no one,
not even Thom Wright or Jeff Taylor, was that easygoing with their body—
everything was always slightly shy and muffled, you’d shower quickly and
then walk back to your locker with a towel wrapped around your waist, and
then hurriedly change into your boxers or briefs. But Matt Kellner seemed to
revel in his nakedness and I secretly reveled in it, too.

I HAD BEEN going to Matt’s house on Haskell Avenue in Encino ever since
a July afternoon in 1980 when we were both sixteen and two of about forty
students at the Buckley summer program. I had failed Geometry and Science
the previous semester, and Matt had failed them as well, and during breaks in
these morning sessions we attended in order to pass those classes so we could
move on to the eleventh grade, we started hesitantly talking to each other
even though we never had before. Had I seen Urban Cowboy, he asked; he’d
been to an advance screening of Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie on the
Universal lot a week ago; was I a fan of “Funkytown” by Lipps Inc.? Matt
liked that song as well as the new Queen record, The Game. And in that first
week he invited me to the house on Haskell—his parents were away, we
could go swimming, get high—he was so amiable and friendly that it
bordered on stoner parody and I wasn’t thinking about anything else except
sex when I listened to him because I instinctively knew—not that Matt
seemed gay at all—there was the possibility for something sexual to happen;
it might not have existed in the invitation itself but there was a suggestion
about the invite that was going to let me initiate this somehow and the path to
Matt’s house became familiar that summer. He lived in a pool house in the
back of his parents’ palatial Encino estate, retrofitted into a kind of hip beach
shack with a nautical theme: a shellacked dolphin hung from one wall, pastel
surfboards were resting against another, an elaborate aquarium ran the length
of the room filled with swordtails and pearl gourami and starfish and
multicolored snails, and coral beds lined the bottom of the tank lit in shades
of blue and green and purple. The room was complete with a stereo, a large
TV that had the Z Channel connected to it, and a refrigerator stocked with 7-
Up, Corona and bags of pine-green weed, and sometimes a cat—Matt had
named it Alex for some obscure reason—would slink into the pool house and
sprawl out in front of the aquarium, staring up at it blankly, licking its paws.
That July afternoon we got high and swam in the pool, first in bathing
suits and then naked, and the moment Matt suddenly tugged his off—from
where I was wading I saw he was half hard as he rested on a hammock strung
between two palm trees, sunning himself—I realized what was going to
happen and I hitched in a breath as I pulled my suit off and tossed it on the
edge of the pool and began swimming toward Matt. I didn’t want anything
from him except his full-lipped mouth surrounded by light razor stubble, his
muscular thighs, the chest with defined pectorals that tapered into a tier of
abs, the small line that crept up from the patch of brown pubic hair and ended
at the knot of his navel, and the long cock that jutted out from that patch, and
his ass, pale and tight and dimpled, very lightly dusted with blond down. At
first it hardly mattered to me what resided within this form.
—
THESE MEETINGS LASTED throughout our junior year. I would
occasionally drive over to Haskell Avenue, park on the street, unlatch the
gate to the path that led to the backyard and the pool house, and I usually
came unannounced, because Matt never picked up his phone, which added to
the erotic suspense of the moment. When I arrived Matt was almost always
stoned and usually damp from swimming and either concentrating on rolling
a small pile of joints or staring at a movie on the Z Channel he’d watched a
few times that week and was still trying to figure out or maybe he was
holding a textbook that might as well have been written in Mandarin given
the perplexed expression on his face, and sometimes Alex the cat would be
lying on his lap staring at me blankly whenever I appeared. Matt was almost
always wearing the tight lime-green bathing suit he preferred that year, and
though he seemed momentarily distracted whenever he saw me, by a certain
point we barely said anything to each other when I’d appear in the open
doorway and went directly to sex. Matt didn’t know the niceties of small talk
—our presence was enough—and he was usually stiff in ten seconds or
already rock hard by the time we stripped and shared the perfunctory kissing
that led to the sex. I doubt it ever took longer than ten or fifteen minutes to
get off unless I forced us to prolong whatever we were doing, which would
end up mildly confusing Matt, though he went with it. I suppose you had to
be standing on one side of the aisle to appreciate Matt Kellner’s beauty, but
forty years later, sitting in my office high above West Hollywood, I still find
Matt’s body the most erotic and beautiful I’ve ever seen and been privy to,
and the fact that I had an intimate and hard-core access to all of it leaves me
somewhat stunned as I write this at fifty-seven. And yet Ryan Vaughn, who I
later confessed my relationship with Matt, wasn’t interested and seemed
surprised that I’d been. Not my type, Ryan said. Too Jew-y.
—
DESPITE THE INTENSITY of the sex and the fact that we could fuck two or
even three times on a particular afternoon, there was ultimately nothing to
hold on to, no basis to build a friendship, and I’m not even sure, as I said, that
Matt Kellner was actually gay, or just a massively horny teenage boy who
could go either way depending on what was available. But I didn’t care and
maybe I preferred the ambiguity: there were no gay signifiers, just like there
weren’t with Ryan Vaughn—everyone was good at maintaining a pose—and
it wasn’t self-consciously butch either, it was something more natural and
boyish than simply that. Susan Reynolds might have been the only one who
knew about Matt—it wasn’t in anything specific she asked, but whenever she
mentioned him it had a vaguely teasing air, as if she had certain information
that she didn’t want to divulge. She only knew that I had a “friendship” with
Matt (quotation marks hers) but no one else I knew ever asked about him so
no one seemed to care that we frequently hung out together in the pool house
in Encino. Maybe no one asked because Matt and I didn’t interact with each
other our junior year—we might acknowledge one another in the hallway by
our lockers with a nod, or maybe half-smile if we shared a class or glimpsed
each other at assembly or in the parking lot but we rarely hung out in public
—we never went to a restaurant or a movie together. Matt didn’t seem to
hang out with anyone—and I began to understand Matt preferred it that way;
he wasn’t crushed by loneliness or doubt or insecurity—he was simply on
another planet. I wanted access to the more popular world that Matt didn’t
care about, and hanging out with Matt, and only Matt, wasn’t going to keep
that ambition in play our senior year, and so I became alienated from him. On
a sexual level I found him porn-star sexy but I never fell in love, the way I
ultimately did, for a brief moment, with Ryan—Matt had become a
dissatisfying problem that wasn’t worth it. Swimming with Matt in the pool
behind the mansion on Haskell Avenue and then stumbling into the
guesthouse dripping wet and locking the door behind us and fucking in the lit
glow of the aquarium, our bodies tinted blue as we positioned ourselves on
his mattress, timing ourselves so that we could come together, were
afternoons I found achingly erotic until I didn’t.
—
I NOTICED SOMETHING WAS SLIGHTLY OFF about the pool house that
Labor Day afternoon—I sensed it almost immediately when I arrived but it
wasn’t obvious and I couldn’t tell exactly what was wrong. Maybe it was due
to the distraction that the guesthouse reeked even more pungently of weed
than it usually did, or the images of forest fires raging in Riverside I noticed
replaying silently on the TV screen, or maybe it was “Ghost Town” by the
Specials echoing loudly throughout the space. Matt was wandering around
idly looking for something and wearing only the lime-green bathing suit and
a string of puka shells collared his neck that I hadn’t seen before, and he was
deeply tanned, bronzed, his hair bleached lightly by the sun—a boy who
lived in the pool. He didn’t notice me at first as I stood in the open doorway
and when he finally acknowledged my presence it was with one of the
blankest looks I’d ever seen. “You didn’t call,” he said. “You didn’t answer,”
I said. “Ghost Town” ended and Matt looked at the drawer he was
rummaging through and when he glanced at me again he finally sighed as I
made my way toward him and held his face in both hands and hungrily kissed
his mouth, smelling like chlorine and marijuana and suntan lotion. The door
was closed. I had already started to undress. Matt slipped off his bathing suit.
I pushed the sex further than it usually went that afternoon, because it
might’ve been the last time it would happen. I wanted to make a final
impression on Matt and I wanted him to come hard and I kept stopping him
from having an orgasm, pushing his hand away from the cock he was
stroking, until I was ready, but I wanted him to come first, and then he was
clenching up, his legs and ass lifted and spread, panting fuck fuck fuck and
while rocking on his back exploded across his stomach and chest, streaking
them white—and then I pulled out and came quietly, staring at him as he
looked up at me, shaking, his face a confused grimace, breathing hard,
grasping the wrist of the hand that was stroking myself to orgasm. Afterward
he was lying next to me, a knee raised, his fingers lightly strumming his
reddened chest, his panting subsided, his stomach spattered with both of our
semen. I turned to look at him: his face and neck were flushed, and his
forehead glistened with sweat, and I was close enough to make out the very
faint traces of acne on his chin. He seemed distracted and lifted his head to
scan the room. Again, in the silence of the pool house I noticed an element
missing—a sound, a noise, movement that I associated with the room—but I
couldn’t place what it was. My eyes were drawn to the Foreigner 4
promotional poster hanging on the wall, which I’d never seen before. When I
asked Matt where he got the poster, he shrugged and said someone had
simply left it in the mailbox and he decided to pin it up, it looked cool, he
liked Foreigner. Typical, I thought.
“What did you do this weekend?” I asked quietly.
“Do?” he asked back as if he was mildly surprised. He glanced over at
me and then rested his head on the comforter we were lying on and fingered
the puka shell necklace.
“Yeah, did you do anything?”
“No,” he said flatly. “Nothing. Just hung out.”
“I went to Debbie’s,” I said. “She was having a thing at her house in Bel
Air.”
Matt stared at the ceiling and realized he was expected to say something,
and without any malice, asked: “How’s your girlfriend?”
“She’s okay,” I said. “Thom and Susan were there. I think Jeff and Tracy
are seeing each other. I think they started dating over the summer.”
I realized the moment I said this that Matt had no interest whatsoever in
our classmates’ social rituals and dating lives. And he didn’t say anything—
just lay there, naked, lightly running his fingers over his chest. He reached for
a box of Kleenex by the bed and wiped his stomach off. He contemplated the
tissue before tossing it at the wastebasket by his desk. He handed the box of
Kleenex to me.
“There’s a new kid,” I said, watching as Matt got up off the bed and
wiped his stomach again with a nearby beach towel crumpled on the floor
that he also ran through the crevice of his ass and then tossed in the hamper
below the recently hung poster of the Foreigner 4 record as he walked over to
his desk, where he started rummaging around, his back to me; it was littered
with empty cans of soda, comic books, take-out wrappers, frozen-yogurt
containers, a soccer ball, a stack of neatly folded T-shirts. I looked around the
room trying to figure out what the missing element was and then landed back
on Matt. When he turned around I noticed there were traces of our semen
lightly draped across his chest that he’d forgotten to wipe off.
“Yeah?” he asked. “What do you mean?”
“There’s a new kid in our class,” I said. “Robert Mallory.” I not only
don’t know why I said the name, I was surprised that I even remembered it.
“Oh,” Matt said. “Cool.”
“Yeah, it’s just a little weird.”
Matt shrugged and then turned around and dropped to his haunches and
kept opening the bottom drawers of his desk, staring into them. He stood up,
his hands on his hips, and scanned the room again. “Weird?” he murmured.
“Why is that weird?”
“Well, it’s just weird that someone enrolls senior year,” I said. “That’s
all.”
“Yeah,” he said. “I guess.”
“Maybe we should just keep to being friends,” I said suddenly.
Matt walked over to a dresser across the room and opened a drawer.
“Did you hear me?”
“Yeah,” Matt said tonelessly. “I just have no idea what you’re talking
about.”
“This,” I said, gesturing at the messed-up bed, the stained comforter, the
half-empty bottle of baby oil. “Maybe we should lay off this for a while.”
It was too quiet. That sound was missing; an ambient noise I was used to
was no longer there. I pulled two tissues from the Kleenex box and wiped
myself off.
“You don’t even need to say that,” Matt said, squinting around the room.
He reached over to his desk and put on his glasses—he used them for reading
but mostly wore contacts.
“Well, I don’t want you to think that I don’t care,” I said.
“I don’t think anything,” he said, glancing over at me, holding it. “I don’t
think anything.” His eyes returned to whatever he was looking for. “I mean,
what are you doing? What do you want?” He asked this in a quietly
frustrated, almost pleading voice.
I pretended that I hadn’t heard him as I reached for my underwear,
slipped the briefs on while lying on the bed and then sat up and grabbed my
Polo shirt off the floor, again distracted by the silence in the room. And then
my eyes glanced over at the aquarium: it was filled with water and the blue
and green and purple lights were still glowing but the cover was missing, and
it was empty. All the fish had disappeared. The sound of the filters and the
bubbling that had emanated from the tank was gone. The filters had been
turned off. That was the missing sound.
“Wait a minute,” I said. “What happened to the aquarium?”
He looked over, acknowledged it, shrugged. “I don’t know.”
“You don’t know what happened to the aquarium?” I asked. “You don’t
know why your aquarium is empty?”
“No,” he said, more concerned with what he was looking for than what
had happened to the aquarium. “I came back the other day and I noticed they
were gone.”
“What are you looking for?” I asked, annoyed. “Jesus, Matt.”
“My pipe,” he murmured.
I saw it resting on the nightstand next to the bed: a brass bowl with an
orange glass mouthpiece. “Twenty fish just…vanished?”
“Yeah, they’re gone,” Matt said. “It’s weird. I don’t know.” He reached
into another drawer, still searching for the pipe. “I don’t remember doing
anything to them, if that’s what you were going to ask me. All I know is that
they’re gone.”
“Do you think maybe…the cat did it?” I finally asked.
He looked over at me and we both started laughing.
“You think Alex ate all my fish?” Matt was cracking up. He threw his
head back.
“I don’t know,” I said, still laughing. “Would Alex do that?”
“I don’t think so,” he said, convulsing. “But maybe we’ll never know.”
“Why?” I asked, pulling my Polo shorts on.
“Well, the cat’s missing, too,” Matt said, catching his breath.
And then we both started laughing again.
I’d like to say that the conversation between the two of us on that Labor
Day in 1981 was more consequential than what I’ve recounted here—that
perhaps there was closure, a shared sense that we were both moving on from
whatever we’d created and continued for the last year; but despite what
turned out to be our final shared laughter, I felt I’d embarrassed myself and
wanted to leave, and Matt never seemed to care whether I stayed or left. I
noticed it was already dark out—school would be starting tomorrow. “It’s
there,” I said, gesturing to the pipe on the nightstand. He walked over to it
and picked the pipe up, grinning, and I was still grinning too about the
mystery of the aquarium, and yet it seemed to be just another example of
Matt’s inability to figure things out—there was nothing proactive about him,
he drifted along carelessly, he hung up posters left in his mailbox—and as he
filled the bowl with a small pinch of weed that he picked out of an open
baggie I realized that I was going to be disappearing soon and that he would
care about my absence as much as he seemed to care about the cat, the empty
aquarium, the world at large. Matt went over to the stereo, bent down and
lifted a needle, and the Specials started singing “Ghost Town” again—This
town is coming like a ghost town—and I left the guesthouse without saying
goodbye.
—
I DROVE ONTO VALLEY VISTA from Haskell Avenue and glided along
the deserted boulevard—there seemed to be no one out on that Monday, the
unofficial last night of summer, but through the open windows and sunroof of
the Mercedes I could smell the charcoal from various grills and hear the
delighted cries of children cannonballing into pools, and every so often I’d
catch top-forty songs playing from radios in backyards, and I was reminded
that even though we lived in supposedly glamorous Los Angeles this was
also suburbia, filled with quiet tree-lined neighborhoods, kids riding bikes in
the empty streets, swimming parties and barbecues. I was listening to Peter
Gabriel’s “Games Without Frontiers” over and over (…Whistling tunes we
hide in the dunes by the seaside…) as I moved from Encino into Sherman
Oaks, and I found myself mindlessly heading toward Stansbury Avenue and
the school located there. I was originally going to drive past Stansbury and
make a right onto Ventura and let it take me through Studio City, where the
boulevard became Cahuenga, and then head into Hollywood, cruising along
Sunset until I hit Beverly Glen—a circuitous route back to the house on
Mulholland—because I didn’t feel like going home just yet. But I drove up
Stansbury until it dead-ended into a cul-de-sac where the closed gates of the
Buckley School appeared and the brick wall with the school’s name in gold
letters greeted its students, carefully trellised with ivy and lit by a streetlamp.
The school spanned eighteen acres and was mostly darkened that night.
There were rooms lit in the library and the administration offices as well as
the occasional sodium light that dotted the hillside, illuminating the path up
to the sports field, which was visible from the top of Beverly Glen when you
were looking downward at the campus but not at the end of Stansbury, where
only the deserted parking lot, the bell towers beyond the gates, and one or
two buildings were within view—everything else was dark. I parked in the
curved driveway next to the entrance gates and lit a Djarum. “Games Without
Frontiers” kept building as I sat in the car and smoked the clove cigarette: the
sliding guitar, the synth bass, the militaristic cadence of Gabriel’s vocals, the
whistled melody adding an eerie vibe to the darkness of Buckley and the
black night. Adolf builds a bonfire, Enrico plays with it…
And then I noticed something in the stillness of the school.
It was by the library, which was situated adjacent to the parking lot laid
out just beyond the school’s gates.
I saw the lone beam of a flashlight traversing over the trees that lined the
hillside the library was nestled beneath.
And judging from where the beam emanated it was in the courtyard
below the second floor of the two-story building and whoever was holding
the flashlight steadied it until the light wasn’t moving anymore, as if the
beam was focused on something—I first noticed the light guiding whoever
was holding it down the stairs and along the walkway that led into the
courtyard, which wasn’t visible from where I sat. And I wondered what it
was focusing on: the benches beside the koi pond, the statue of the school’s
mascot, the Buckley Griffin—a mythical creature with the body of a lion and
the head and wings of an eagle, a gold life-sized edifice rising up on a stand
beside the koi pond—the small waterfall that quietly cascaded into it, the date
palms draping over the space.
In the driver’s seat I sat up, leaning my head down, pushing the visor up,
to get a better look through the windshield. The beam moved again through
the darkness, and then settled on a space just a few feet away from where it
had originally been. The movement of the flashlight wasn’t random—it was
precise, as if it knew exactly what it was looking for. Was it a night
watchman? I wondered. And then I was confused as to whether Buckley even
had a night watchman. I turned and craned my neck and saw the darkened
security booth that was always manned during the day and there didn’t seem
to be anybody occupying it that night—there was only a beige van parked
next to it. I thought briefly maybe it belonged to one of the campus
groundsmen prepping the school for tomorrow’s reopening.
The beam moved again to yet another angle and I turned down the
volume on the Peter Gabriel song and almost immediately heard the high
wavering cries of coyotes somewhere on the distant hillsides surrounding the
school. Whoever was holding the flashlight had heard them too, seemingly at
the same time I did. The beam of light, which was slowly moving again,
suddenly stopped and then quickly swung across the hillside as if it was
searching for what was emitting these sounds—the faint howling that
signified the animals’ hunger.
And then the light was gone, snapped off.
I thought for a moment I’d imagined it but in the next instant knew I
hadn’t, and then I realized that whoever was holding the flashlight, searching
the courtyard of the library, was probably heading toward the parking lot.
This was an assumption my mind made—it was the drama the writer
encouraged. But instead of leaving, I waited, hypnotized by the sounds of the
coyotes lightly filtering through the silence of the night. The clove was still
lit, smoke lightly curling out of the sunroof, and I thought about the movie
Halloween. I thought about Matt’s empty aquarium and his laughter over
Alex the missing cat, “Ghost Town” echoing out over the darkened pool, the
Foreigner 4 poster pinned above the hamper. I suddenly thought about the
deserted house on Mulholland waiting for me and couldn’t remember when
my parents told me they were coming back—first week of November or was
it later? I was worried in a way I hadn’t been; a small dark wave crested over
me. I actually shivered, momentarily disoriented. And then I couldn’t hear
the coyotes anymore: their howling had subsided. It was completely silent. I
waited but didn’t know what I was waiting for.
And then the flashlight snapped back on, blinding me, glaring through
the windshield.
Whoever was holding it stood behind the gates, a shadowed figure,
maybe six feet away from where I sat, just a black shape, a mass.
I didn’t shout or jump in my seat. Instead I simply started the car and
quickly drove away, the flashlight trained on me as I turned out of the
driveway, glancing in the rearview mirror as Buckley and the beam of light
retreated behind me until I was at the end of the block, where I turned off
Stansbury and back onto Valley Vista. I immediately headed to Beverly Glen,
which would take me to Mulholland Drive and the empty house. I decided
not to drive around the city and instead take a Valium from the canister my
mother left me, read a few chapters of Cujo and drift off to sleep. If the
Stephen King book was too creepy maybe I’d pick up my mom’s copy of The
White Hotel and read that instead. These were the thoughts I had as I traveled
upward on Beverly Glen, trying to distract myself from the nebulous worry
that was floating somewhere vaguely in the distance.
—
THERE WAS A MESSAGE from Debbie on the answering machine in my
bedroom—because of how wired she got from the cocaine she’d stayed up all
night and slept through the day and wanted to know where I was; she pleaded
for me to call her back, it was so important, her mother was a wreck and
Susan’s faking it with Thom and she missed me. But I was keyed up and
didn’t want to talk to her—I was suddenly paranoid, even fearful, about how
vulnerable I was in the empty house on Mulholland. I turned on all the lights
as some kind of warning to the intruder, positive he was approaching, ski
mask on, butcher knife clenched in gloved fist, and would bind me with rope
and sacrifice Shingy, and wondered what Matt Kellner would have done if I
drove back to Encino and asked if I could spend the night. Shingy didn’t want
to go outside. Maybe the dog registered the faint howling of the coyotes,
which seemed closer than usual, and that’s why he was lightly shaking, bent
into himself on his pillow in the kitchen, and I kept thinking I heard someone
on the patio and, emboldened by the Valium I’d taken, headed out onto the
deck, where I scanned the yard and the blue-lit pool and heard the coyotes
roaming the canyons on their nocturnal hunt but saw nothing. The Trawler
kept vaguely crowding my mind and I made sure all the doors were locked
and the alarm activated. I couldn’t deny it: the air felt charged, electrified
even, and though it was warm out on that last night of summer I found myself
shivering again, on the veranda staring into the darkness, with expectation,
with dread, with the promise of fear fulfilled. I wanted to relax in the Jacuzzi
but I was too afraid to sit outside by myself, and so I took another Valium
and fell into bed. I couldn’t let go of it: something had come into the city, a
presence had arrived, and this was activated by not only the lone flashlight on
the Buckley grounds but also by the mention of a new boy in our class,
someone who was going to join us, and participate in our rituals and games,
our secrets and evasions, the low-key dramas and the shadowy lies. This was
the night before we met that boy, Robert Mallory, for the first time.
4
I DON’T REMEMBER WHEN THE VALIUM kicked in and relaxed me
into a deep and dreamless sleep, but I woke up at seven-thirty and, realizing
Rosa would be arriving at eight, I reached for the small bottle of Johnson’s
baby oil I kept in my nightstand and quickly masturbated—at seventeen I
always woke up with an aching erection—thinking about what happened with
Matt yesterday, and then moving on to Ryan, and then the fantasy went, as it
sometimes did, to that boy I glimpsed at the Village Theater when I saw The
Shining last year: I had built an elaborate porn dream around him and there
were certain scenarios and positions involving the boy that my mind would
race to and quickly get me off. I hopped through the backyard naked, only
holding a beach towel, and stepped into the Jacuzzi, submerging myself in
the heated water as Shingy wandered the lawn and quickly defecated, having
not gone out last night. I could hear the steady stream of cars traveling along
Mulholland behind the boxwood hedge: the morning felt animated, the world
was waking up to a new season, and I no longer felt the trepidation and
anxiety from the night before while soaking in the Jacuzzi beneath the earlymorning sun. Shingy sniffed around the edges of the lawn, occasionally
running from side to side, seemingly excited to be alive.
I stepped out of the Jacuzzi, wrapped the towel around my waist and let
Shingy follow me across the deck to the entrance of my room, where he raced
past the bed and down a hallway into the rest of the house. I switched on
Good Morning America, then showered. As I usually did when I was
younger, I studied myself naked from all angles in the bathroom’s mirrors
while I brushed my teeth because I wanted to make sure I looked good—this
was the summer I’d created a small gym in a room adjacent to the garage
where I worked out: free weights, a bench, a treadmill I ran on while listening
to my Walkman. I had become overly concerned about how I looked, and it
bordered, at times, on anxiety, and in the summer before my senior year I was
trying to aim for whatever the physical ideal was in that moment and realized
I was somewhat succeeding. That morning Graham Parker was on my stereo,
The Up Escalator record—I clearly remember “No Holding Back” playing—
as I put on my Buckley uniform: tailored gray slacks, a white Armani buttondown tucked in with the tiny insignia of an eagle on the chest, a Gucci belt,
striped tie, burgundy penny loafers, and I made sure everything was in place
—the hair boyishly tousled, the face free from the stubble that had started
appearing last year, the eyes rinsed with Visine—before I grabbed the blue
blazer with the Griffin insignia on the jacket’s pocket from a hanger in the
walk-in closet and slung it over my shoulder as I left the bedroom that Rosa
would straighten up while I was at school. We can face the danger baby no
holding back…
—
BY NOW IT WAS eight-thirty and I was running late. Instead of Rosa
making me breakfast I just threw some Frosted Flakes into a bowl and
quickly wolfed them down while flipping through the pages in the
entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times, noting that I wanted tickets
to the ELO tour that had just kicked off—they’d be at the Forum on the 23rd
—and then quickly checked the “Metro” section and was surprised and not
surprised to see that there was a home invasion on Sunday night where an
unidentified victim was attacked, this one in Century City, in a residence
above Santa Monica Boulevard, just a block from where Avenue of the Stars
began—this was the first one since June. I read it in a blur, it didn’t matter, I
just needed the headline on page 4 of the “Metro” section to confirm the
assault. I grabbed the paper bag that contained the lunch Rosa had prepared
and said adios and moved toward the garage. She was making a list for the
store—she always headed to Gelson’s at the beginning of the week—and
asked if there was anything I wanted. I called out Estoy bien.
My mother drove a sea-foam-green Jaguar XJ6 and my father had left his
cream-colored 450SL when they separated and he moved to Mountaingate, a
gated development that looked over the 405 freeway, its entrance on a
deserted section of Sepulveda not far from the house on Mulholland, and had
recently bought himself a silver Ferrari. I wasn’t driving the green four-door
450SEL anymore and had taken the top off the SL, a sporty two-door with
chestnut interior, and started driving it when my parents left for Europe a
week earlier. A seventeen-year-old boy (I’d be eighteen in March) tooling
across Mulholland in a convertible Mercedes dressed in a private-school
uniform and wearing Wayfarers is an image from a certain moment of empire
that I was, at times, self-conscious about—did I look like an asshole? I’d
briefly wonder—before thinking: I look so cool I don’t care. A mixtape
playing Blondie’s “Call Me” completed my American Gigolo moment as I
headed toward Buckley, and yet the excitement of it somewhat diminished
because I was soon stuck in traffic backed up along Beverly Glen heading
down into the San Fernando Valley. I usually took Woodcliff to Valley Vista
but on that first day I drove across Mulholland to Beverly Glen because I’d
wanted to show off—and now I was paying the price.
And there were cars backed up on Stansbury Avenue, moving slowly
toward the entrance gates of the school, where students were being dropped
off—a line made up of Cadillacs and Mercedes, Saab station wagons and
Jaguars, along with the occasional miniature yellow van with “The Buckley
School” written in black cursive lettering on its sides. If you arrived at
Buckley early enough you’d miss the peak traffic backed up on the
residential street, or if you timed it so you arrived just before classes began at
nine you’d avoid it as well—I miscalculated that morning and this was when
my relatively good mood started getting rewired. Once inside the gates I
pulled to the left, toward the high school, and slowly drove to the parking
spaces set aside for seniors only. Ryan’s black Trans Am was parked near the
front of the row and he was waiting in the driver’s seat, looking at something
in his lap while listening to music, probably the J. Geils Band, which was the
last cassette that had been in his car when I was in it mid-August, though I
was hoping he was simply waiting for me. I blanched when I thought this: the
fantasy of a little prince. There was a slight adrenaline rush in seeing him but
as I pulled the 450SL into an empty space I became distracted by the police
car parked discreetly in the alley behind the library and I immediately
wondered why it wasn’t parked in front of the building—it didn’t want to
announce itself, I realized, and it was almost as if it had been hidden so as not
to alarm any of the students on that first day of school.
—
RYAN WAS OUT OF THE TRANS AM and waiting for me as I walked
through the parking lot after pulling the top of the Mercedes up: it seemed
everyone was there already, the spaces filled with Mazdas, Fiats, Camaros,
Jettas, Jeff Taylor’s Porsche 924, Debbie’s white BMW; only a few were
empty. And I wondered which car was Robert Mallory’s as I scanned the lot
walking up to Ryan. His blue-eyed blond-haired blankness would have
soothed me on any other morning but I was suddenly nervous, uneasy about
something, a new mood was descending, the jitters from last night had
returned, and instead of simply saying hi, coolly basking in his beauty, I had
to say, “Why did you leave Debbie’s the other night?” His expression
changed, became concerned. “Good morning to you, too.” He was playing a
game, enacting a part, and because he wasn’t taking it that seriously he
inhabited the role beautifully: you couldn’t tell he was acting even though I
was the only one who knew he was. It was just something he had to do until
he got out of here and escaped our hermetic world. “Please, don’t be a
pussy,” he added.
“I almost called you yesterday,” I said.
“I’m sorry but that whole thing—”
“What whole thing?” I cut in.
“The Schaffers. Grosses me out.” He shrugged. “I thought I could deal
with it but it’s not for me.”
“Thom was there, I was there—”
“Stop. Don’t be a pussy,” he said again, lightly pained.
He was leaning casually against the Trans Am, wearing his letterman
sweater—burgundy and striped with gold, hanging just below the waist,
stylish with brass buttons, something that looked as if you could purchase it
at Fred Segal. “Why didn’t you call me?” he asked quietly.
“I don’t know,” I said. “Something stopped me.” I paused. “Wasn’t sure
if you wanted me to.”
“Yeah, of course, I did,” he said, softening, as he glanced around the
parking lot.
“Well, you could have called me.”
“I did.” He directed his gaze back to where I was standing, just a couple
feet away. I noticed that Thom’s Corvette was pulling into the lot, slowly
nearing us, which was what Ryan had been glancing at. I could see Susan in
the passenger seat, checking her face in the visor’s mirror.
“When?” I asked, distracted.
“In the afternoon.” He added for light emphasis: “Twice.”
“You did?”
“Yeah.”
I didn’t tell him I was at Matt Kellner’s, though I doubt Ryan would have
cared.
“I guess I was out by the pool,” I lied easily. “I never heard the phone.”
He straightened up and casually saluted Thom as he drove past us toward
an empty space, Styx wafting out of the Corvette.
“Let’s talk later,” Ryan said.
“Are you paranoid?” I suddenly asked.
“Um, I’m…practical, I guess.” He watched as Thom parked the car and
then he and Susan were heading over to us. “We’ll make a plan later. I want
to hang out.” The way he said this had an erotic finality when he added,
“With you,” and it lightly jolted me, adding to the general unease I was
beginning to feel that morning.
I had already turned to Thom and Susan and even though we’d all seen
each other at Debbie’s on Sunday night we greeted each other somewhat
formally, the guys nodding and ironically saying “Sir” while Susan kissed
both Ryan and me on the cheek, and then the four of us started walking
toward the bell tower that led into the high-school side of campus. “How was
the movie?” I asked.
Thom and Susan seemed momentarily confused.
“The John Belushi thing,” I reminded them. “Sunday night.”
“It was okay,” Susan said. “It wasn’t very funny.”
“I fell asleep,” Thom admitted. “It was a romantic comedy, or supposed
to be.”
“You should have asked Debbie for some blow,” I said.
Thom snickered. Susan rolled her eyes.
“She was totally high. She was whispering to me through the whole
thing,” Susan said. “And then she was always leaving to deal with Liz, who I
guess was totally trashed upstairs and losing her shit. Just another night at the
Schaffers’.”
“I know, I ran into Liz on my way out,” I said. “Did Terry come in? Did
he watch the movie?”
“I didn’t see him,” Susan said. “Hey, why did you leave?” she asked
Ryan.
“I actually had dinner plans with my family,” Ryan said. “I was over in
Westwood picking up some college info at UCLA and that’s why I decided to
stop at Debbie’s.”
These were all lies: I knew that Ryan didn’t have a dinner planned with
his family and that he had no intention of applying to UCLA, let alone the
grades to get in, and I wondered if Thom or Susan even vaguely realized this.
Susan glanced over at me and then back at Ryan. “You should have stayed, it
was fun.”
“Yeah,” Ryan said. “I had plans.”
“Too bad,” Susan said, glancing over at me again.
“Was it really that fun, Susan?” I asked pointedly.
I wanted this to sound like a joke but it came out as if I was scowling.
Susan, unflappable, shrugged, and said, “Well, I had a good time.”
I watched as Thom reached for her hand. I noted Susan’s slight
hesitation.
—
NONE OF THEM NOTICED THE police car, or said anything, but its
presence had altered my mood and as we were heading toward the
administration office to go over our individual schedules for the year I had an
overwhelming desire to see the library’s courtyard—I sensed that something
had happened there, and that what I’d seen last night was connected to the
presence of the police car. And I don’t know why I just didn’t act on that
desire but instead I remember walking with Susan and Thom and Ryan until
we arrived at the door of the high school’s central building—like most
buildings at Buckley it was a low structure, a bungalow, classic stucco with
Spanish tile roofs. Everything at Buckley was outside: there were no
hallways, each classroom was, in fact, its own bungalow, with walkways
connecting them protected by eaves, and it was the administration office that
I drifted into as if in a dream on that first day of school. Senior year was more
flexible than any other and if you had problems with your schedule then the
first morning back was the time to correct it, make changes, switch things
around if you wanted to, anything to accommodate members of the senior
class. But I didn’t care, it didn’t matter what courses I took, I just wanted out,
there was nothing to change because none of it made any difference, I was
going to be a writer, I was working on my novel, that’s what I cared about.
People I hadn’t seen since June and barely recognized in my distracted state
were walking in and out of the office; as with everything else at Buckley the
scene was always calm and controlled and orderly, but that morning
everything seemed in slow motion, fragmented, haunted, vibrating with lowlevel anxiety.
I remember Dr. Croft was also there, holding a miniature Perrier bottle,
while seniors consulted with various secretaries, and he approached Susan
wanting to talk to her about what she was going to say at the mid-morning
assembly and they disappeared into his office, adjacent to the waiting area.
“Anyone see the new guy yet?” Doug Furth asked Ryan and Thom—both of
whom shrugged while comparing their schedules with mine. David Walters,
the headmaster, walked into the office—a space laden with furniture from
Sloane’s and ferns draped across tables and a LeRoy Neiman painting taking
up an entire wall and discreetly lit and next to an antique grandfather clock
and the huge bouquets of fresh flowers in two massive vases—and he
reminded everyone that it was after nine and the first class of the day had
already begun, and he would see everyone later at assembly. Stacks of the
new roster were lined against the flat top of the counter separating the waiting
area from the secretaries and I picked one up and opened it to twelfth grade,
and saw Robert Mallory’s name between Rita Lee and Danielle Peters, and I
suddenly felt as if I was being watched—I had experienced this sensation last
night as well, when I left Matt Kellner’s and on Stansbury Avenue parked in
front of the gates and in the darkness of my own backyard.
I was in a full-blown daze, gripping the open roster, staring at the name,
when Debbie kissed me lightly on the lips, materializing like an apparition,
clear-eyed, made up, a centerfold, any sign of a druggy weekend now
completely wiped away. I recovered slightly and realized that Thom and
Ryan were still standing next to me comparing schedules—what to change,
what to move around, “maybe move Study Hall to last period so we can leave
early”—when Debbie announced excitedly that someone had “desecrated”
the Griffin statue in the courtyard of the library.
“Desecrated…” Thom said, confused.
“It was vandalized,” she confirmed.
“Probably Harvard guys,” Ryan said.
“What did they do to it exactly?” I asked.
“No one knows,” Debbie said. “They blocked off the courtyard.”
“That’s why the police are here…” I murmured.
“You didn’t call me yesterday,” Debbie whispered.
“I’m sorry, babe.”
“I know.” She smiled ruefully. “You were getting ready for school.”
The atmosphere was hushed, everything seemed embalmed in that dream
I walked into: the flat green carpeting I was standing on could have been a
lake, the hum of the air conditioning was the distant wind before a storm, the
handsome students in uniform were robots, everyone talking scripted
dialogue in low voices. On the surface the room conveyed the elegance and
control that Buckley emanated, but it all seemed unreal, as if I was making it
up and yet, conversely, couldn’t control it. Debbie whispered about a new
club, actually a “space” on Melrose, she wanted us to check out this week,
maybe Thursday night, it wasn’t officially open yet, it played videos in empty
rooms, there was a bar, someone named Attila had told her about it. I
shrugged as I usually did whenever she wanted me to do something. To
Debbie, I had realized over the summer, the constant shrugging on my part
suggested a kind of masculinity—a strong, silent type I was supposedly
embodying when, in fact, I just didn’t care. Something died in me while I
stood in the administration office on that first day of our senior year when I
realized we wouldn’t be graduating until June—there would be ten more
months of this pantomime—and a new depression landed on me. I was in a
uniform, a costume, pretending to be the boyfriend, taking a year’s worth of
classes I had no interest in, disguising myself: I was an actor and none of this
was real. This was the takeaway on that Tuesday morning in September.
I forced myself to pay attention as Debbie and Thom left for their first
class, Spanish III, and Susan and Ryan and I headed to American Fiction, but
as we entered the classroom I excused myself, telling Mr. Robbins my throat
was dry and I needed a drink of water.
—
THE WALKWAYS were empty as I made my way to the stairs leading to the
courtyard below the library—there was no one out, everyone was either in the
administration building or in class, since school had officially begun. At the
top of the stairs there was a barricade made up of a sawhorse and two orange
traffic cones, blocking the path that led into the courtyard—the only other
way was through the library itself, which still hadn’t been opened, an
anomaly since it was usually the first building everyone had access to, the
initial gathering place of the day. I paused, glanced around and then bypassed
the sawhorse and the pylons and walked casually down the steps. The space
was surrounded by walnut trees and sycamores, and I could hear the
songbirds nesting in them, and beyond that the waterfall lightly splashing into
the koi pond. The first thing I noticed was Miguel, the head of maintenance,
who had been at Buckley since I was in seventh grade, as well as the school’s
head of security, Angelo, who I also knew, quietly conferring with two
policemen, armed and in uniform, and who I later found out were waiting for
a crime-scene photographer to take pictures of the desecrated statue. I neared
the Griffin before any of them noticed me but I didn’t understand what I was
looking at. It seemed comical at first—a harmless prank, Kleenex, red dye, a
wig—until I got closer.
Blood was splattered everywhere in congealed pools below the statue,
and the Griffin itself was streaked with it but there was nothing that
suggested where the blood had come from, what its source was—it was
simply brought from another location. The koi pond was still filled with
water but there were about twenty dead fish, white and orange and black,
strewn beneath the statue of the Griffin, all of them gutted with their heads
cut off. The decapitated heads had been somehow pasted onto the statue,
decorating it in circular shapes, creating a pair of female breasts, and another
gutted koi was hanging between the Griffin’s legs, mimicking a penis, and
clumps from what looked like a wig—blond and shiny and synthetic—had
been pasted on the crotch of the statue to resemble pubic hair. Gobs of
entrails from the fish had been draped over the Griffin’s head, a glistening
black-and-pink-and-red toupee, above a face where two white fish heads
were pasted on with blood to resemble eyes and another white koi was
arranged over the Griffin’s mouth, meant to mimic a bloodstained smile, a
leer. I had barely grasped the crudely elaborate horror of it when Miguel
called out, “You shouldn’t be down here, Bret—go back up,” and made a
motion with his hand. The cops and Angelo stared at me grimly as I obeyed
Miguel, backing away, literally trembling, finally noticing the flies and gnats
swirling around the statue and the pools of blood.
Ryan was wrong: there was no way this was a group of Harvard jocks—
it was too perverse, too disgusting. In my shock I remembered with dread that
I had actually witnessed whoever had done this the night before when I sat
parked in my car at the school gates and watched the beam from the
flashlight traverse back and forth across the darkened courtyard and the
adjoining hillside. I remember distinctly thinking that morning—it arrived
automatically, there was no hesitation—it would only complicate things for
myself if I offered any information to the police about an intruder I saw on
the school grounds last night. I didn’t want to be a witness, I didn’t want to
get involved, I was afraid. I automatically decided to stay quiet—this was, I
felt, the easiest option for me. The desecrated statue offered a narrative that I
didn’t want any connection to—I didn’t want to be part of the story: it was
too awful. And as I walked numbly up the stairs and onto the walkway that
would take me back to class I couldn’t help but think, again, that there was
someone watching me hidden in the hills that surrounded the school, through
either a pair of binoculars or a camera with a long lens or the telescope of a
hunting rifle. I remember thinking that for the first time in my life I was so
disoriented it felt like I was melting, dissolving in on myself, becoming
another person, and then disappearing into nothing, the incredible shrinking
boy.
—
THE REST OF THE MORNING I was lost in my own movie—I couldn’t
pay attention to anything. I only pretended to concentrate on the book I’d just
opened or contemplate whatever Mr. Robbins or Miss Sylvan had scrawled
across a chalkboard. At one point between first and second periods I asked
Susan if she had a Valium but she could only offer a Quaalude, which I
didn’t want—I wouldn’t have made it past lunch if I’d taken it. She asked me
what was wrong—she noticed—but I didn’t tell her, or anyone else, about
what I’d seen. The slow-motion dream that began in the administration office
had sped up after I saw the awful damage inflicted upon the statue, and I
assumed that not talking about it, not even referencing it, would make it
recede from memory—I wanted that image of the desecrated Griffin erased
from my mind. But trying to grasp the madness of whoever had done this
caused a light fear to start streaming forward, accelerating everything, and
sooner than I thought possible we were at the mid-morning assembly and the
entire high school—about three hundred students—was congregated in the
massive courtyard, the plaza beneath the Buckley Pavilion, where the campus
indoor athletic arena was, and concerts and school musicals were staged, and
which also contained an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a basketball
court. A sea of blue blazers looked up to the American flag as the Pledge of
Allegiance was recited followed by the Buckley Prayer. Headmaster Walters
and Dr. Croft made short speeches about the importance of leadership and the
rigors of challenges, and promised that creative excitement and personal
fulfillment lay ahead for all of us.
—
SUSAN WALKED TO THE MICROPHONE—she was student-body
president—and as she overlooked the assembly area the loud applause
continued and it was joined by a high-pitched siren of wolf whistles
emanating from what seemed like almost every male in the plaza: this would
have been discouraged now but in 1981 everyone, especially Susan, took
delight in the appreciation of the moment. She didn’t read off cards or from a
script because she didn’t have much to say—this wasn’t a pep talk (Susan
was too cool for that). She just casually welcomed everyone back; reminded
everyone about Homecoming and that the designs for class floats needed to
be approved by the last week of September; said that anyone who wanted to
sign up to be on the editorial board of The Buckley Gazette, the student
newspaper, should please contact Doug Furth, or, to work on Images, the
student yearbook, contact Suzie Todd or Debbie Schaffer; announced that the
musical this term would be Mame and auditions started next week. Coach
McCabe and Coach Holtz invited the captain and quarterback of the varsity
football team, Thom Wright, to introduce the lineup this year, announcing
Ryan Vaughn as co-captain, while U2’s “I Will Follow” burst from a tower
of speakers and the eleven guys that made up the Buckley Griffins bounded
up the steps and formed a line amidst cheers coming from the plaza. No one
mentioned the vandalized statue in the library courtyard that morning.
I noticed Matt Kellner standing on the far reaches of the crowd by
himself, and though he cheered with everyone else as each name of the
football team was called out by Thom, I knew Matt was going through the
motions, following a script like I was, far away from it all, and, knowing him
intimately (I had been inside him yesterday), I could see the distance in the
stoned gaze even though he was grinning. To anyone casually glancing at
Matt Kellner that morning the grin might have looked genuine—but to me it
was a rictus. Matt, a tan ghost with short brown hair streaked blond from the
sun, was another reminder that I’d checked out sometime during my junior
year and was performing a pantomime in which I only noticed the edges of
things, the fringes of campus, the outlines of people, and this was why
someone like Matt Kellner preoccupied me, because he was on the periphery
as well. It surprised me that being back on campus reignited my contempt so
suddenly and doomed any of the optimism I’d been feeling the past few
weeks. This was not going to be the happy year I’d foolishly envisioned and
hoped for over the summer; whatever excitement had been caused by my
own faulty wiring. I realized too late while standing in the courtyard below
the Pavilion on that first morning back, that I hadn’t been paying enough
attention to the actual script.
—
THE SOFT CHIMING OF THE BELLS announced it was midday. There
was no cafeteria at Buckley, so students brought bagged lunches, and since
we resided in Southern California we always ate outside. There was a stretch
of table-benches with umbrellas along the side of the building that housed the
science labs where most juniors ate, and the seniors always took over the
tables in the shadow of the Pavilion that overlooked the assembly plaza
where ten picnic tables were lined, evenly spaced apart. And though seniors
could basically eat anywhere they wanted on campus there was a kind of
hierarchy at play with the seating situation at lunch: seniors got the Pavilion
tables, juniors took over the benches in the courtyard, sophomores sat along
the tables by the arts-and-crafts bungalow. Small cartons of cold milk were
made available for all grades in blue crates left on the steps of the Pavilion
right before lunch and I reached for one as I headed to where Thom and
Susan were sitting with Debbie, who was saving me the space next to her, at
the center table, the table that was most visible to everyone and was pulled
away from the other nine tables and had the best sightlines of the campus—it
might as well have been a throne. Everyone could see us.
Some students were better-looking, a few were more charismatic and
athletic, there were a few who had more money and those whose parents
were famous, which added its own kind of cachet, but the uniforms we all
wore discouraged the idea that someone was “better” or “different” than
anyone else—you could deal with that unfairness after you graduated, in
college, out in the real world—and the quietude of the campus aided in this
notion that was supposed to protect us. The fact that the number of students
in each grade was small—just sixty and no classroom exceeded fourteen kids
—also encouraged something other than a popularity contest: the opportunity
to show off or fixate on somebody was minimized by the rules and structure
of the school. And yet it was unavoidable that certain people captured the
student-body imagination in ways others didn’t—Susan Reynolds and Debbie
Schaffer certainly with their looks, and Thom Wright was our king because
of his handsomeness and athletic prowess, his bro-jock amiability, and
though this popularity, this high-school notion of power, probably mattered
more to Debbie Schaffer than to anyone else—she got high on exclusivity—I
supposed that Thom and Susan were so used to their status that they didn’t
know anything else, that they accepted it as a given, their right, and didn’t
even have to try, unaware that people fantasized about them. My popularity,
as someone who didn’t play sports and avoided extracurricular activities, was
tied into being Thom and Susan’s closest friend, that was my in, that was
how I was seen, the sidekick, the fifth wheel, I was famous because of my
close proximity to them, this was how it had been for a long time—but I truly
didn’t care now, it didn’t matter to me, and it mattered even less as I moved
numbly toward the center table in the shade below the Pavilion on that first
bewildering day of school.
—
BUT I SMILED AS I SLID onto the bench while the girls shared a
pomegranate in mid-conversation with rumors about the statue of the Griffin
—no one knew what had been done to it or the ways it was vandalized.
Earlier, in the administration office, Dr. Croft told Susan confidentially that
they weren’t going to mention “the rumor” at assembly—he told her only that
the kois in the pond had been “removed,” and that was it. I was tempted to
describe what I’d witnessed but realized they might not have believed me: the
blood, the gore, the dead fish, the gruesome fish-leer, the sexualizing of the
Griffin, the dripping koi-penis and the white tits made of fish heads, it was
too outrageous. Plus I knew that Susan and Debbie would take me to task for
what they saw as my tendency to embellish. Susan had always been fond of
chiding me about additional details I’d lace a story with, as well as what I
concealed, and she’d often interrupt and explain to the listeners that it didn’t
really happen in quite that way, Bret’s exaggerating. But I was a storyteller
and I liked decorating an otherwise mundane incident that maybe contained
one or two facts that made it initially interesting to be retold in the first place
but not really, by adding a detail or two that elevated the story into something
legitimately interesting to the listener and gave it humor or surprise or shock,
and this came naturally to me. These weren’t lies exactly—I just preferred the
exaggerated version.
I also realized that the desecrated statue had made me forget about the
new student, Robert Mallory, and I suddenly looked around to see if I could
spot him.
From a distant boom box somewhere, the Clash were singing “The
Magnificent Seven”—I looked up to see where it was coming from and felt a
pang when I saw Ryan Vaughn eating lunch with Anthony Matthews, Jeff
Taylor, Kyle Colson, Doug Furth and Dominic Thompson—just the guys.
Ryan was laughing, describing something with his hands, seemingly enjoying
himself—he was genuinely animated, and not pretending, and I wanted to be
sitting next to him in that moment: when he seemed to be real. What
happened to those days last spring when we sat away from everyone else, lost
in our secret flirtation, on the verge of sharing how we actually felt about
each other? I realized: we weren’t eating together because Ryan, after what
happened in my bedroom in August, thought we were now officially a secret.
I was trying to pay attention to what my table was talking about and not
saying much, just staring at the lunch Rosa had prepared for me—the group
was accustomed to my silence, they thought it was writerly—though I
announced that I wanted to see ELO at the Forum and asked if anyone
wanted to get tickets and I remember the moment when Thom stopped midsentence and looked up curiously, offering his warm, friendly, blank smile to
someone, and Susan turned from Thom to glance at whatever had interrupted
him, and this was followed by Debbie, shifting beside me. It was very quiet
and warm out, pleasant and sunny, Mediterranean almost, and the hum of
voices beneath the umbrellas continued, undisturbed by a new presence.
Someone had approached the center table, the most popular table, as if he
had intuited this without knowing any of us.
From my vantage point, forty years later and knowing exactly what
happened that fall, I could paint something more sinister in retrospect, but
there was no reason to do so on that day because the boy standing at our table
was calm and dreamy, and seemed vulnerable and innocent. He was
hesitantly reaching out to us and needed our guidance.
—
THE FIRST THING I SAW: Topsiders with no socks. And when I looked up
the question for me became: How could the cut angles of Robert Mallory’s
face, jawline, cheekbones be more handsome than Thom? Why was Robert
Mallory suddenly so much sexier than anyone else even though, just like
Thom and Ryan, he looked all-American hot and belonged in a movie and the
pages of a fashion magazine? Maybe, I thought, it was because I’d known
both Thom and Ryan for five years and accustomed to the way they looked
and Robert Mallory was a new presence—he suddenly appeared out of
nowhere and this was why he made such a seismic impression.
Robert was six foot and the way he wore his Buckley uniform—
everything seemed a size smaller—exaggerated the broadness of his
shoulders and the slimness of his waist; his hair was dirty blond, on the short
side, parted in the middle, feathered back, the style for most Buckley boys in
that moment; the eyes were brown and almond-shaped, long lashed with
thick lush brows; there was a classic aquiline nose with a small bump near
the top, which added to its perfection; the lips were pink and full—a mouth
you noticed and were drawn to; there was a light cleft in his chin, and his skin
was tan and smooth, no traces of acne; the cheeks were only very slightly
sunken and when he smiled there were dimples. He had taken advantage of
his senior status and modified the uniform: besides Topsiders with no socks
he’d opted out on the blazer and his tie was loosely knotted, and the sleeves
of his white dress shirt (Ralph Lauren, Polo pony on the chest, typical of
Buckley guys) were rolled up, revealing tanned forearms, almost hairless and
lightly veined. You could softly smell him: it was soap or lotion or shampoo,
it came somewhere from his hair, his body, his skin. It was cedar,
sandalwood, as if he had just walked through a forest of citrus. There was
smokiness to the scent as well, ashy, a simmering bonfire on a deserted
beach, the salt air mingling with the evaporating flames. Or this is how I
remember it. He was, like Thom and Ryan, a movie star, a friendly Greek
god.
“Hey, you’re Susan Reynolds,” the guy said. “Right?”
“Yeah, you must be Robert,” Susan said, smiling, surprised.
“Yeah, hi.” He said this with a certain degree of shyness that was
appealing. “Dr. Croft told me you’d be here and, um, showed me your
picture.”
“I hope not the ones he keeps in his desk,” Susan deadpanned.
Robert was confused for a moment and then pretended not to be and
laughed politely. “Ah, no. It was last year’s yearbook.” He paused, staring at
her. “Nice photo. I recognized you immediately.”
“Hey man,” Thom said, half standing, holding out a hand. “I’m Thom.”
“Robert,” he said, shaking it, looking Thom directly in the eyes.
“I’m Debbie,” the girl next to me said with an intonation that hinted at
exaggerated curiosity. I noted the way her voice became higher on the second
syllable of her name. “So you’re the mysterious new guy.”
“Mysterious?” Robert asked, a little startled. His innocence and polite
confusion were beguiling, I thought.
“Ignore her, she’s kidding. I’m Bret,” I said, shaking Robert’s hand,
which I glanced at. The hand was large, the fingernails were short and pale
and clean, and he looked away from Debbie and stared at me, smiling and, as
with Thom, making direct eye contact; this was seductive, he wanted me to
like him and he squeezed too hard before realizing and then his grip lightly
softened as he pulled away—a nervous first impression. I had to force myself
not to smell my palm—I remember that clearly even though I don’t
necessarily recall the specifics of the dialogue from that lunch, just the
generalities of Robert’s story, his supposed outline, the official narrative he
wanted to push. Nothing at that initial lunch directly hinted at what would
happen to us later that fall but, if I’m looking back, there were clues
everywhere.
—
I REALIZED QUICKLY that it wasn’t as if I wanted to get to know Robert
Mallory as much as a feeling I already did; that I’d seen him before but I
couldn’t tell from where and I was too disoriented by his magnetic presence
to figure it out right away, or guess about this undisturbed. And I became
even more quietly frazzled when Thom and Susan invited him to join us and
slid over on the bench so Robert could sit down—he was now directly across
from me and I had to breathe in and compose myself while smiling
mindlessly at him. But a question forced its way through and I couldn’t help
it—there was something about him I couldn’t shake off: I knew this boy. I
asked, before anyone said anything, if we had met at a party or a club, was he
ever at the Seven Seas or the Odyssey, the Starwood or the Whisky. Robert
glanced at me, again a little startled, and said, “No, man, I don’t think so.”
And added: “I really don’t go out much. I really don’t know anyone in L.A.”
I believed Robert, because everything about him seemed momentarily
authentic and there was no reason not to—why would he lie about being at
the Seven Seas before graduation? And he really was so disarmingly
handsome I drifted away from interrogating him. I had imagined that
whoever Robert turned out to be was probably going to get marginalized
because he wouldn’t have enough time to become close with anybody in the
hermetic world of our senior class, but I automatically realized upon meeting
him this wasn’t going to be the case: His looks would open every single door.
They would also hide any flaws he might be harboring. His beauty would let
him get away with anything. I just stared at him.
There were about twenty minutes left of lunch until the next class began.
Robert started telling us why he was late that day—he arrived at LAX
last night, he overslept, he’d barely unpacked, he couldn’t find his uniform,
he got lost coming from Century City because he overshot both Benedict
Canyon and then Beverly Glen and ended up on the 405 at Sunset before
realizing he had to get on the 101 and take the Woodman Avenue off-ramp.
Thom interrupted and asked Robert if he’d ever been to the school
before.
“No,” Robert said. “This was all kind of a last-minute thing.” He threw
that line out as if it didn’t warrant an explanation. It landed and he moved on.
When he arrived at Buckley it was already eleven-fifteen and he had an
orientation meeting with both Dr. Croft and Headmaster Walters, and once he
got his schedule figured out they told him he should meet the student-body
president, Susan Reynolds, who would be by the Pavilion, at the senior
tables, and handed him a map and showed her photo instead of walking
Robert themselves because they were late for a quick lunch with generous
alumni at Ma Maison in West Hollywood, a hot spot on Melrose with an
unlisted phone number, and whose sous-chef would murder a young actress a
year later, an acquaintance of Susan’s and Deborah’s—all of which will, I
suppose, give a sense of the empire world we inhabited and the men who ran
it in 1981.
I also remember very clearly that Robert had become distracted by my
uneaten sandwich and admitted that he mistakenly thought there was a
cafeteria at Buckley so he didn’t bring lunch. I gestured at the sandwich
—sure, you can have it—and he grabbed half of it and brightly said “Thanks”
and took a bite without inspecting what it was, mimicking relief and chewing
hungrily, the muscles in his jaw clenching, unclenching, and he
complimented whoever made the sandwich—it was delicious, he said with a
full mouth. While he ate the sandwich and then absentmindedly reached for
the opened bag of Lay’s potato chips, I realized that Debbie, pressed next to
me, was probably thinking about the ways she might be able to use him—she
didn’t flirt, she was just amused and trying to figure out the limits of Robert’s
malleability. He would definitely be included in everything Debbie planned
because of his newness, of how exotic he was, and she began throwing out
questions, keeping it light and casual, while Susan seemed to retreat into a
private place within herself, suddenly guarded and quiet; by comparison
Thom seemed to be paying complete and devoted attention to Robert, staring
at him as if he was a potential friend and not a rival, which to me, for some
reason, he so obviously was.
—
ROBERT LAID OUT HIS background for us as if it was a job interview he
needed to pass: he again confirmed that he arrived from Chicago only last
night and even though he had regularly been visiting Los Angeles, off and on,
since the summer of 1980, and staying with his aunt, his father’s sister, at her
condo in Century City, he’d never fully familiarized himself with it and
always felt a little disoriented—he knew Century City, Westwood, Beverly
Hills and the beaches but not Hollywood or the Eastside or the Valley; and
this was the reason he was late today. The last time he’d been in L.A. for any
sustained length of time was ten months ago, when he came out for the
holidays in December and stayed with his aunt through mid-January before
returning to Chicago in order to finish out his junior year at Roycemore, a
prep school in Evanston.
“Why are you living with your aunt?” Debbie interrupted.
He explained that since his parents’ divorce Robert had been living with
his mother in Lincoln Park but when she died—in what he only referred to as
an accident—Robert moved in with his father, who lived in Forest Glen with
a wife Robert had never gotten along with, and their “crazy” teenage
daughter from the wife’s first marriage, and the acrimony between Robert
and the three of them was reaching an explosion until his aunt intervened,
suggesting Robert relocate to Los Angeles and live with her and she would
enroll him somewhere for his last year of high school. Robert’s father, who
wanted to send Robert to a military academy, initially vetoed his sister but
this past May had a sudden change of heart and acquiesced.
“And here I am,” he said, shrugging, making eye contact with each of us,
smiling, showing off a row of impeccably straight white teeth.
Robert had gone through this quick backstory, filled with undercurrents
of pain and loss, rejection and a dead parent, almost good-naturedly, as if it
happened to someone else. The info might have been presented earnestly but
it seemed, by one point, rehearsed—as if it was something Robert
remembered but hadn’t necessarily lived through. He offered this information
in a weirdly emotionless way that verged on the hollow. On one level Robert
was intriguing enough to make me momentarily forget about the Griffin
streaked with gore but something unsettling about him had announced itself
and was a reminder of the strangeness of that day: the police car parked in the
alley behind the library, the congealed pools of blood and the mutilated koi
scattered around the statue in the courtyard, a new boy materializing before
us.
I suspected there was something wrong with Robert Mallory almost as
soon as I met him. But it was just a feeling. I had no proof.
—
THOM AND SUSAN REACTED TO ROBERT in different ways: Thom
seemed to like him though he was slightly disappointed when Robert said he
didn’t plan on playing any sports that year, which quieted Thom with an
“Okay, man.” Susan listened patiently—not withdrawn exactly and it didn’t
seem as if she was trying to ignore Robert because we were all part of the
conversation, he was talking to all of us—but at times it seemed as if she was
hoping he would go away precisely because Thom and Robert had
immediately bonded, which had to do with how welcome Thom made Robert
feel. Thom always gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, Thom always
liked everyone, Thom always trusted people, it was part of his charm, Susan
knew and should have expected this. And there was a subtle thing happening
that I noticed and no one later commented on: Robert was trying, it seemed,
not to stare at Susan, even though the principal and headmaster told him to
seek her out and introduce himself to her. Maybe it came down to shyness on
Robert’s part: I don’t think Susan ever looked more dazzling than she did on
that September afternoon when she was seventeen and at the height of her
prom-queen beauty—and this was simply too intimidating. Susan, I thought,
was completely oblivious to Robert’s glances and lost in her reveries but in
her own quiet way, often just demurely studying the seeds in the pomegranate
she and Debbie were sharing. I’m not sure if Thom noticed this but at one
point he moved closer to Susan, almost as if it was a protective gesture,
maybe even a mild warning to Robert Mallory: she’s hot, she’s mine, we’ve
been together two years, we’re going to get married, it’s cool, dude, it’s okay,
man.
I kept looking at Robert while moving closer to the answer as to how I
knew him but our world in that moment was still a distraction, and though my
head was clearing and I was beginning to figure this out, the question hadn’t
been answered yet.
For some reason I looked over at Ryan two tables away: he was sitting
very still, making his jokey What’s up? face at me, a parody of tense
helplessness, his lips pulled back, his eyes bugging a little, a punk visage—a
joke we would make in reaction to our surroundings ever since we started
hanging out at the end of junior year, a silent acknowledgment of how
alarmed we were by what passed for normalcy in the fake enclaves of the
world we were moving through. But I didn’t make the face back. And then
everyone was getting ready to go to the next class—the bells chiming
signified the end of lunch. Robert stood up and unfolded his schedule along
with a map of the campus. Now, forty years after the events of 1981, writing
about this initial meeting with Robert Mallory, I look back at that lunch
filling in the gaps, somewhat clarifying the evasions, because I know what
ultimately happened: I know the secret narrative.
—
THE FIRST THING I GLEANED that afternoon in only twenty minutes:
Robert Mallory, on the surface, was one of the most charming people I’d ever
met; handsome and intelligent with good manners, likable and sexy. And the
other thing I gleaned: he was a total and complete liar. He hadn’t proven this
yet, it was just a feeling I had—but there was something too rehearsed about
him that was the tip-off, even when he tried to cut loose with a joke about an
ex-girlfriend also attending Roycemore last term and who he broke up with in
June. (It turned out there wasn’t an ex-girlfriend who attended Roycemore,
because Robert Mallory didn’t spend the last term of his junior year at
Roycemore either.) Instead, there was a carefulness that bordered on a bogus
formality behind what he’d hoped was a casually hip and loose façade—Hey,
I’m just another dude like you guys. In retrospect, I realize now, Robert made
so many slipups that week, so many evasions that bordered on lies, and none
of us were paying attention to them because we were so unnerved and
delighted by him, blinded by his newness and beauty. Robert felt he needed
to make as much of an impression as possible in those initial days because he
needed everyone to perceive him as normal—that was his plan—but it also
seemed to me, and later to Thom Wright, when it was too late, that Robert
Mallory was already playing a kind of game with us. And it didn’t help that
his beauty made me feel as if I was collapsing inside—it didn’t offer
pleasure, it just created confusion and caused a faint, dull pain in my chest. I
was the only one, I believed then, who intuitively understood that Robert’s
handsomeness was going to alter everything around us: I wasn’t going to be
its only victim, there would be other casualties.
Later, I found out that Susan intuited this as well, but didn’t know that
day in September she was going to be its main target.
—
AND THEN THERE WAS the moment as lunch ended when I realized with
an almost near certainty where I’d first seen Robert Mallory and why I knew
him.
This was also the first time in my young life that I remember going cold
inside. I’d read about this sensation but I’d never felt it until that moment in
the courtyard beneath the Pavilion—it was as if an icy wave had quickly been
flushed through my system, freezing my body, jolting me into awareness, and
I shivered because I knew exactly where I’d seen him.
Robert Mallory, in the late spring of 1980, walked the sloping aisles at
the Village Theater in Westwood searching for someone as the opening
credits of The Shining began.
The boy who had been sitting across from me during lunch that
afternoon was the same boy I’d glimpsed in the theater.
I was so dumbstruck by this revelation I couldn’t help but blurt out a
question.
“Did you see The Shining at the Village Theater in Westwood when it
first came out?” I asked.
Robert turned to me, clutching his crumpled schedule, and said with a
complete blankness, “No,” and nothing else. I would get used to this blank
look: detached with a barely concealed insectile urgency whirring behind the
innocent gaze.
“Are you sure?” I asked. “I’m positive I saw you there.”
“Really?” Robert asked, bewildered, then amused. “Positive?”
“Yeah, I’m almost totally positive I saw you there.”
Robert looked at me, now only a little confused. “Why would you
remember me there?” he asked. “Did I do something to you—”
“No, no—”
“Did I say something to you—”
“No, no. I just saw you a couple of times in the theater.” I became
bolder. “You, uh, just made an impression.” I left it there.
“I haven’t seen that movie,” Robert said. “So, yeah, I’m pretty sure it
wasn’t me.”
“Well, I’m almost positive I saw you there,” I murmured. “In the theater.
On a Saturday.”
“No,” Robert said. “That wasn’t me.” There was blankness and
detachment, yet his eyes seemed worried, as if I’d found out something about
him that he didn’t want anyone to know.
“Weird,” I murmured. “Very weird.”
“Were you, like, following me or something?” he asked.
It was a strange question even though it made sense later, after
everything happened, but in that moment the only concern I had: how to
process the fact that he was lying and I knew he was. And yet I didn’t correct
him or ask once more, Are you sure? I didn’t describe to him what he’d been
wearing or that he’d been chewing gum or that he went to the restroom about
an hour into the movie and made eye contact with me as he walked up the
aisle—but it was the same boy, there was no doubt. The boy I’d fantasized
about in a variety of ways since that May morning in 1980 was the boy who
turned out to be Robert. And on that first day of school we didn’t know
anything about how his mother really died, or the rape of his stepsister, the
suicide attempt, or Robert Mallory’s stint, during what should have been the
last term of his junior year at Roycemore, in a mental institution outside
Jacksonville, Illinois.
5
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON happened, I suppose, and then the bells
were chiming and the day was over. I say “suppose” because I was so
distracted by Robert I remember nothing of the remaining three classes. I
suppose I walked the pathways and neared a bungalow and opened a door, I
suppose I stepped into an air-conditioned room and placed my textbooks on a
desk and scanned the chalkboard, I suppose I glanced outside the tinted
windows when someone walked by and everything moved within the orderly
mandate Buckley imposed. Nothing comes back to me until I remember
meeting Susan beneath the bell tower in front of the library, where she was
waiting for Debbie, the two of them were going to drive over to Fiorucci and
then Debbie would drop Susan off at her place in Beverly Hills since Thom
was at football practice. Susan, on that Tuesday afternoon, seemed slightly
melancholy and a semi-fake smile greeted me as I neared her, leaning against
the stucco base of the bell tower—and maybe this supposed sadness
accentuated how beautiful she was becoming as she moved through
seventeen, the gravity of it placing her into another realm of beauty. Beyond
us kids were getting picked up by a long line of cars that snaked past the
gates and onto Stansbury Avenue, and a train of miniature yellow buses and
vans exited the campus in a row, driving past the palm trees that bordered the
gates, two of the security guards directing traffic.
“Hey,” we said to each other.
“Sure you don’t want to join us?” Susan asked.
“What am I gonna buy at Fiorucci?” I said. “I want to get home and
work on my book.”
“Okay.” She sighed, resigned. “You’re lame.”
“Is everything all right?” I asked. “You seem kind of bummed.”
“Bummed?” she asked. “Really? I’m not bummed.”
“I thought I noticed something at lunch,” I said vaguely.
“I think you’re making things up,” she said. “I’m definitely not
bummed.”
“I thought something threw you off,” I said, wanting her to comment on
Robert Mallory without mentioning him.
“Really? At lunch? No. Why?”
“Okay,” I said. “Maybe I’m wrong.”
“No, in fact, I’ve been thinking that I want to throw a party,” she said.
“That’s exactly what I was thinking before you showed up. A party.”
“Bummed girls think of throwing parties all the time,” I said.
“I’m not bummed, Bret,” she said, smiling widely as if to prove this.
“When are you going to throw this party?” I asked.
“You’ll see, you’ll get an invite,” she said, purposefully coy.
“Well, then, why are you throwing a party?”
She paused, then cocked her head. “To. Bring. Everybody. Together,”
she said in a sickly-sweet voice.
“You’re scaring me.”
In that moment I thought of the supposed dissatisfaction with Thom that
Debbie had hinted at and my mind flashed on his hand reaching for Susan’s
while she reclined on the chaise by the pool the other night and her hesitancy
in taking it both then and this morning in the parking lot as we walked toward
the bell tower. I wanted to ask about Thom but instead we watched
Mr. Collins, a young intense Irishman with the prerequisite fiery green eyes
and ginger goatee who taught junior-high English, pass us on his way into the
library, neatly suited and holding a briefcase—Mr. Collins was one of the
reasons Debbie Schaffer wanted to add a “Hottest Teachers” page to the
yearbook. I seemed to be the deterrent as to why Mr. Collins didn’t stop and
talk to Susan and just nodded at us.
“You know, he hit on me a couple of times last year,” Susan said. “He’s
extremely flirtatious.”
“I know,” I said. “You told me.”
“Sometimes I flirted back,” she said. “Did I tell you that?”
“You’re crossing boundaries,” I said. “You’re taking it all in stride.”
“I’m the girl in the Police song.”
We were playing a game. “I always knew it.”
“Sometimes it’s not so easy to be the teacher’s pet.” She said this
ruefully.
“And I know how bad girls get.” We were quoting the lyrics to the song.
“Do you think I should let him fuck me?” she asked casually.
“What would Thom say?” I thought I was playing along.
She looked away from the library doors Mr. Collins had just disappeared
behind. Something hard creased her features. “What do you think he’d say?
Jesus, Bret.” She was suddenly annoyed.
“Why are you asking me that? What’s wrong?”
“Because I’m pretty sure you’d already know what Thom would say, so
why are you asking me—”
“Hey—”
“I was joking, Bret—”
“Maybe I just wonder if you’re still happy with Thom,” I said. “Debbie
thinks you’re faking it.”
“That’s Debbie’s story,” Susan said. “I don’t know. I’m pretty happy.
Thom’s great. I’m just…ansty, I guess.”
“So what did you think of the new guy?” I asked.
She froze a little and then, hesitating a moment, asked: “What did you
think about Robert?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “He seems…nice.” I was vague again, as if
directing this answer to someone else, the air, a vacant space, the hillsides
surrounding the campus. The way she hesitantly said his name made it seem
so strangely intimate.
Debbie’s BMW pulled up to the curb where we were standing. She was
behind the wheel, wearing Wayfarers, a scrunchie in her hair, and Romeo
Void blared out of the sunroof. Debbie leaned over the passenger seat as
Susan walked away from me and said through the open window, “I’ll call you
later, baby—and I want to talk to you and not the answering machine,” and
pouted her lips. I nodded and gave a little wave of reassurance. Susan headed
toward the car and reached for the passenger door.
“Hey,” I said.
“Yeah?” She turned around.
“You didn’t tell me what you thought of Robert,” I said.
She mimicked someone pondering a great mystery, cocking her head
again, two fingers at her chin, and then casually tossed off in a mock-British
accent: “Well, I thought he was rather electrifying.” She looked at me. “Be
honest. Didn’t you?” And then she slipped into the car and shut the door and
Debbie made a quick U-turn and drove through the parking lot and past the
gates, leaving me momentarily stunned.
—
BUT I PUT MY SUNGLASSES ON and headed toward the 450SL and
noted in the distance Thom’s Corvette and Ryan’s Trans Am just a few
spaces away from each other, and a wave of melancholy struck me—Thom
was with Ryan at practice on Gilley Field, I was not. It was three-thirty and
the lot was less than a quarter full, most of the remaining cars belonging to
members of the varsity football team. I suddenly wanted to know which car
Robert Mallory drove to Buckley that morning and, scanning the lot, landed
on a black Porsche 911 and guessed this was his: I hadn’t seen it before. Jeff
Taylor rolled alongside where I was walking and pressed his head against the
driver’s window, making a zombie face, the muffled sounds of the B-52s
playing from inside the car, and I just nodded coolly back, carrying a couple
of textbooks in one hand and my keys in the other. Even though it was only
the second week of September autumn skies were arriving and in the very far
distance, where the senior parking lot ended at a series of spaces below a
concrete wall pushed up against the hillside, everything was bathed in a faded
yellow light that announced the changing season, and I noticed Matt Kellner.
Matt was standing by his car, a red Datsun 280ZX, and he’d changed
into a T-shirt and tennis shorts for the drive back to Encino—Matt was never
comfortable in his Buckley uniform, or clothes in general, and he kept
squinting since he faced the sun, engaged in a conversation with a student
whose back was to me. Matt was trying to explain something and made a
sweeping gesture with his arm, arching it over his head for emphasis. Based
on his expression he was in a mild state of confusion, but since Matt always
seemed semi-bewildered it didn’t mean anything serious to me. And yet there
was something different about him—I noticed a bristling anger in his
expression as I walked closer—but I was too far away to hear anything Matt
was telling the other person. I remembered yesterday in the pool house—
Matt naked on his bed—and I twitched, immediately turned on. Horniness
destabilized me and I stopped at my car, standing behind it, and took off my
sunglasses, breathing in. Matt looked away from whoever was talking to him
and then glanced back guiltily. He half-smiled at something the person told
him, and then became resigned. I realized the two boys were standing very
close to each other, which suggested a pronounced intimacy that surprised
me, something almost sexual in nature, and I was struck by the back of the
boy talking to Matt, by the snugness of his gray slacks hugging a shapely ass
—and even though I was done with Matt (or maybe not) I was suddenly
jealous, because the fact that Matt was talking to anyone surprised me since
he was such a loner, but maybe there were acquaintances I didn’t know
existed.
I was about to put my books in the Mercedes and start walking toward
Matt when I stopped and realized who Matt was talking to.
This was when the person turned their head, startled by a car horn that
briefly blared across the parking lot. And I caught the profile.
I stared uncomprehending, and noticed I had gone cold for the second
time that day.
I’d only seen Robert Mallory in close-up during lunch. That’s why I
hadn’t recognized him from across the parking lot. In that moment the idea
that Robert and Matt would be engaging with one another bordered on the
outlandish to me.
What could they have been talking about? Robert had given the
impression that he knew no one here. That he hadn’t even been to the campus
before. So how did he know Matt Kellner? Why was he talking to him?
When had he introduced himself?
Robert’s hands were on his hips and it seemed like he kept quietly
interrupting Matt. This wasn’t an angry conversation—there just seemed to
be a misunderstanding that both boys were trying to work out, a debate, some
kind of disagreement. Robert shook his head as if he was hearing something
that disappointed him, and then Matt listened to what Robert was saying and
looked at him with suspicion but nodding. I couldn’t even begin to imagine
the topic of this conversation and landed on maybe Robert had heard that
Matt easily scored the best weed available, but anyone in our class would
probably have directed Robert to Jeff Taylor and not Matt. Neither of them
noticed my presence in the distance from where they were talking.
I opened the door to the Mercedes and quickly sat in the driver’s seat. I
would have usually pulled the top down but I didn’t want Matt or Robert to
see me. When I started the engine music blasted—“Don’t Touch Me There”
by the Tubes from their Young and Rich record. I turned the volume down
and waited.
Matt and Robert walked away from each other and it seemed, maybe,
that something had been clarified, resolved.
Matt got into his Datsun and just sat in the driver’s seat looking at
something in his lap. I knew the ritual: he’d get stoned while listening to the
Specials before heading back to Encino, it would make the ride so much
more bearable, and then he’d spend the rest of the afternoon naked in the
pool, wasted.
I watched through the windshield as Robert walked over to the black 911
and opened the door. Robert scanned the campus as if he was in a
contemplative mood, his handsome profile gazing at the library, and then
across the forested hillsides, thinking something through, before slipping into
the car.
I had to compose myself—because in that moment I was genuinely upset
about this intimate conversation that involved Matt and Robert and which
forced me to make a decision. I drove onto Stansbury Avenue, where I pulled
over halfway down the block and waited as my car idled against the curb.
And when Robert Mallory sped by in the black Porsche I followed him to
Valley Vista Boulevard, where he made a left turn, and I started trailing him.
—
ON VALLEY VISTA I ASSUMED he was going to make a left onto Beverly
Glen, which would take him back to Century City, where he supposedly lived
with his aunt, but Robert instead turned right onto Beverly Glen, which took
him five blocks down to Ventura, where I noted he was going to make a left
onto the boulevard. I didn’t know why Robert was heading into the Valley
but in my vague panic I assumed that, right now, it was tied to Matt Kellner
and whatever they had talked about in the Buckley parking lot. I was directly
behind his car but I really couldn’t see him, because the Porsche’s rear
windshield was so small. There was one car in front of the Porsche when the
light turned green and they both slowly wheeled forward to make the left
onto Ventura and I was the third car in line and worried that I wasn’t going to
be able to make the left at this light and would lose Robert. But there was a
break in the traffic crossing Ventura and streaming up Beverly Glen and I
was able to make the turn with the Porsche as it headed west, curving past the
Casa de Cadillac dealership on the corner and coming to a stop at the red
light on Van Nuys. I waited there, too.
The light at the intersection of Van Nuys and Ventura turned green and I
followed Robert past the Sherman Oaks Newsstand and farther down, at the
end of the block, Tower Records (where Sarah Johnson was abducted from
the parking lot one night in early January, eight months ago) and the grand
Art Deco marquee of the La Reina Theater (Body Heat was playing) as the
Porsche kept moving down the boulevard. Was Robert heading toward
Encino—to Matt Kellner’s house on Haskell? Had they made a plan? A date?
I imagined showing up at the guesthouse by the pool and confronting them as
they smoked Matt’s weed in just bathing suits, wet and high, but then
realized, embarrassed: confront them about…what? I was so keyed up—this
supposed meeting between Matt and Robert I dreamt up had so disturbed me
—my mind was childishly racing around, barely able to focus, vibrating with
suspicion and unease. I might have ended it with Matt but I still felt a certain
propriety: he was mine, even though seemingly no one else desired him the
way I did. Robert’s handsomeness was also a factor in my building panic—
would Matt get sucked into the liar’s world and the three faces that operated
as one, the fake face of Robert, the face whirring behind the façade, and then
the face taking everything in from another angle before figuring out what the
best play was? This was what con men did: Robert had lied about being at the
Village Theater and this drew me to him immediately, it was a seduction.
And if there was no way I wasn’t going to get sucked into whatever he was
planning and if this was happening to me—the watchful, observant writer
who now knew what Robert Mallory was capable of—then what could
possibly be the outcome for dumb, clueless, vulnerable Matt Kellner? “Going
Under” by Devo was playing on the mixtape and I heard, I know a place
where dreams get crushed…
—
I KEPT FOLLOWING HIM, UNAWARE of how close I was to Robert’s
car, lost in my fantasies, not realizing I was pressing down on the Porsche,
making myself obvious, not enough at a distance, and just past the Sav-On
Drugs he suddenly swerved over to the curb to let me pass and I panicked—
why had he done that? What was he doing? But when I looked in the
rearview mirror I watched as the Porsche immediately pulled away from the
curb and started following me, pressing up on the Mercedes, exactly what I
had unconsciously been doing to Robert, but now it was an antagonistic
gesture, an alpha move. I gripped the wheel and kept driving, pretending to
be oblivious, not giving any clues that I knew Robert was now following me,
but I was so startled by the abruptness of this maneuver I almost rolled
through a red light at Kester Avenue. I managed to brake hard and waited, the
black Porsche looming behind me. And that’s when I finally realized Robert
thought that whoever was in the 450SL had been actually following him and
wasn’t just a clueless driver who was grazing the bumper of his car, and so he
decided to switch it around by following them instead: he was playing a
game.
As we waited at the light I glanced into the rearview mirror and couldn’t
see his face through the windshield. The visor was down and only the white
Polo shirt and the red-and-gray-striped tie were visible, his head obscured.
The light turned green and we started moving together, in unison, the Porsche
following too closely, teasing me, and I tried pretending that I didn’t notice
but it wasn’t acceptable by a certain point and it pissed me off that Robert
knew it wasn’t acceptable and a couple of blocks before Sepulveda I said
“Fuck you” and abruptly swung over to an empty spot against the curb in
order to let Robert pass.
But the black Porsche pulled over immediately, swerving to the curb
behind me as if it knew this was exactly the maneuver I’d planned, and the
Porsche timed it perfectly. And now it simply idled, revving its engine,
waiting.
I said “Fuck you” again, this time louder, and waited until the traffic
started moving forward from the light that had just turned green two blocks
behind us. Looking in the side-view mirror, I gauged when I’d be the only car
able to merge back onto Ventura, swinging onto the boulevard without giving
the Porsche enough room or time to follow, blocked by the oncoming stream
of cars.
I gripped the steering wheel and braced myself and then the Mercedes
lunged away from the curb.
And yet the Porsche veered in front of the first car in the oncoming
traffic, which uselessly blared its horn, and resumed tailing close behind me.
Robert played this reckless move in order to prove something—Robert
was tailing the Mercedes to simply fuck with me, to tell whoever was driving
it that the dude in the Porsche was in charge and that he was going to follow
them wherever they went, there would be no escape, because I am relentless.
I looked in the rearview mirror again when I came to the light at the
intersection of Ventura and Sepulveda, where the interchange of the 405 and
the 101 freeways towered above us, but the afternoon sun bathed the
Porsche’s windshield into an orange block of light and I couldn’t see
anything inside the car. How long could I keep this up? I wondered. How far
could I drive? Tarzana? Woodland Hills? Where was I going to escape
Robert, the boy who was fucking with me? Devo became Public Image and I
had to lower the volume on the jangly madness of the music in order to
concentrate when I noticed the white mass of the Sherman Oaks Galleria
across the intersection and decided I wasn’t going to keep up with whatever
game Robert was playing. I’d become offended by his actions even though I
was the one who had started following him, and I looked back at the Porsche
and then at the Galleria and when the light turned green I actually revved the
car and gunned it, racing across the intersection. A half-block past Sepulveda
and beneath the overpass of the 405 was an alley on the right side of Ventura
that took you to the multi-level parking lot of the Galleria, and I abruptly
swerved into it. I braked hard and glanced quickly in the rearview mirror as
the Porsche sped past me beneath the shadow of the freeways.
—
I WALKED THROUGH the second floor of the May Company, situated at
the north side of the mall, and out onto the Galleria’s concourse: it was three
levels surrounding an open space and the entire ceiling was made of glass, an
atrium, where natural light flooded through, giving it a bright center and the
faint impression that it was, in fact, an open mall. The carpeting was mauve,
and chrome railings lined each level and staircases connected the floors along
with two escalators anchored in the center of the mall along with a pair of
glass-walled elevators. My first stop was always B. Dalton’s—browsing
through bookstores calmed me—and as I looked over the latest bestsellers on
the front display table I realized whatever annoyance—even anger—I’d felt
about Robert Mallory was dissipating because it was just a joke, a guy thing,
nothing sinister, I was the instigator, it was all my fault, no big deal, we’d
laugh about it later: everything seemed to float away in the fluorescent-lit
temple of the bookstore.
In 1981 I was in a major Joan Didion phase, a writer that Mr. Robbins,
my English teacher, had introduced us to when he taught Slouching Towards
Bethlehem our junior year, and soon I was taking almost all of my cues from
those essays as well as another collection, The White Album, and her
Hollywood novel, Play It As It Lays, and the particular style and tone she
achieved was what I aspired to as a writer, trying to mimic her prose in the
fiction I was working on. But in the summer of 1981 I was also reading
commercial writers like Martin Cruz Smith and James Clavell, Joseph
Wambaugh and Ken Follett, and I was reading Cujo, which was the numberone bestseller that week, and my mom’s copy of The White Hotel by D. M.
Thomas, also a bestseller, and I soon realized I had enough to read and there
was nothing I really wanted and I was determined to work on my own novel,
waiting for me in the bedroom on Mulholland, where I kept notebooks and
journals stacked next to an electric Olivetti that helped flesh the novel out,
and so I left the bookstore and took the escalator to see what was playing at
the Pacific 4 multiplex even though I wasn’t sure I wanted to watch a movie
that afternoon. When I got there I realized I’d already seen everything: An
American Werewolf in London, Private Lessons, Heavy Metal, Hell Night.
—
IT WAS FOUR. Schools had been out for an hour and yet there weren’t a lot
of kids around. This was the first day back for many of us, and it might have
been too early in the season for kids to head immediately to the Galleria once
classes were done for the day. Any of them who were at the Galleria seemed
to be at the food court, which was the main hangout because of its proximity
to the arcade and the multiplex. The northern side of the food court started
with Chipyard Cookies and then passed along to places like Hot Dog on a
Stick and Kaboby, Mexican Dan’s and Perry’s Pizza, and ended with an
Orange Julius. (A McDonald’s and Taco Bell were located on the second
floor of the mall.) That Tuesday mostly teenage girls in pairs were dotting the
red-topped tables on the overhang that looked out on the mall, private-school
babes from Westlake and Oakwood, pretty and seventeen and SoCal tan, all
of them in their uniforms and lounging under the atrium as the lingering
afternoon sun lit the space. There was a hushed quality that day even though
this was a world made up of adolescence—teens worked the food court as
well as congregated there—but the electric rowdiness that hummed through
the mall’s social scene on busy afternoons and weekends was absent.
Everything was quiet and subdued. I’d turned away from the ticket booth of
the Pacific 4 when I suddenly realized I was hungry since I hadn’t eaten my
lunch (Robert had) and my stomach was growling. I wandered away to the
railings and looked down at the ground floor of the mall three stories below
me—no one was there. I glanced up at the other side of the mall and scanned
the vendors at the food court and nothing really appealed to me—my scan
confirmed this. And when I was about to turn away from the railing I froze
and involuntarily gripped it.
Robert Mallory was leaning against the Swensen’s Ice Cream counter.
—
HE WAS TALKING TO the lone girl working there: generically pretty and
blonde and wearing the Swensen’s antique uniform, which made her look as
if she was presiding over an old-fashioned ice-cream parlor. The first thing I
noticed: she was smiling widely—it was completely genuine, almost dazed.
Robert’s head was cocked raffishly, as if he was doing an impression,
saying something that made her laugh.
I imagined she was trying not to look at him in awe as she handed Robert
the ice-cream cone he’d ordered: one large scoop, pink. He paid for it and she
just stared at him as he walked away pocketing the change. Robert seemed to
know what effect he had on the girl: judging from the expression on his face
he was pleased. He just ambled along the food court, licking the ice-cream
cone, and I realized he had followed me into the Galleria. This was never his
destination—I was the reason. He had turned around on Ventura Boulevard—
made a U-turn—after my car dived into the alley, and I was almost certain
he’d driven through the parking structure until he found the Mercedes and
slid in next to it. When I left the mall this was confirmed: the black 911
Porsche was parked directly beside the 450SL on the lot’s deserted third
level, where there was only a beige van parked in the distance.
Robert stopped, looked around the food court, and seemed to make his
decision on what direction to head based on where the most girls were
hanging: this was the seating area. Two girls passed him as he shuffled across
the orange-tiled floors and then clutched each other, giggling, whipping their
heads back to gawk at the hot guy in the Buckley uniform eating an icecream cone. It played out as an almost-parody of teenage lust. He wasn’t
oblivious to it either when it happened again with another pair of girls—he
looked over his shoulder when he heard their laughter and smiled and just
continued walking in an aimless way through the food court, where he passed
a table of four girls and confidently ignored them as they all leaned in and
whispered to each other, their eyes following him. There was no hint of the
hesitant outsider at lunch beneath the shadow of the Pavilion and I had an
awful premonition about Susan Reynolds, and what would happen to Thom
Wright, and all the potential drama involved, ruining senior year, but I also
hoped in that moment that it was just the writer imagining this and that I was
worrying over nothing. Robert made it to the steps of the seating area, the
ice-cream cone half finished, casually checking the tables out. It all seemed
so innocent.
I was standing behind a column across the mall, watching him. My heart
was actually beating fast and I felt flushed, semi-dizzy from Robert’s
presence and my hunger. I was also aware with a faint embarrassment that I’d
been reduced to this—hiding behind a column, in the Galleria, staking out the
new boy, hoping I wouldn’t be seen.
He walked down the steps into the seating area and just wandered around
until two girls sitting at a table were brazen enough to ask him something.
Robert stopped, pretending to be surprised by their attention, and leaned in,
suddenly inquisitive. He listened to what they said and then laughed,
nodding, which caused the girls to become animated. They talked for only a
moment and then Robert gestured he had to move on, and held up the hand
not holding the ice-cream cone to show them his watch. He walked away
from the table and one of the girls mock-fainted—and when I witnessed that,
the dizziness suddenly evaporated and I became slightly angry. Three girls
sitting at the far edges of the food court motioned him over to their table, and
he strode to it, grinning lazily, lapping at the ice-cream cone—and I realized
he was doing it so he could make them focus on his mouth, his lips, his
tongue. The girls made gestures at each other, probably introducing
themselves, and Robert nodded, listening as they talked, and he answered
their questions in a friendly, gracious way that was undeniably, even from
where I stood, flirtatious. It became apparent that Robert didn’t need to hit on
anyone, because he had an innate confidence—he wasn’t a creepy stalker—
and he was never rebuffed or rejected by any of the girls he chatted with in
the food court. He never approached anyone—in fact the opposite would
happen, because the girls said hi, the girls waved him over to where they sat,
the girls made the first move, while he innocently licked the pink ice-cream
cone, reducing it to a small pale mound. The girls were delighted by Robert’s
presence and his boyish nonchalance and they were almost swooning as he
walked away from them, their faces collapsing into mock grimaces of lovestruck pain and longing. I slowly moved from behind the column when
Robert stepped out of the seating area and noticed two girls he started
following toward the Time Out arcade and then the three of them disappeared
into the darkness of its entrance. I realized I hadn’t been breathing and finally
exhaled loudly, a faint pang repeating in my chest.
I would have found a way to intervene if I’d known how dangerously ill
Robert Mallory actually was. But I didn’t know this yet.
—
I HEADED TO LICORICE PIZZA and stared at a display in the front
window for the new Rolling Stones record, Tattoo You, and there was a
poster for Belladonna, the Stevie Nicks album that had been released in June,
as well as posters still up for the Endless Love soundtrack, which had the
number-one song all summer, as well as the soundtrack for Arthur, and there
was also a poster for the ELO album Time—a reminder to call my dad’s
ticket broker and get seats for the concert at the Forum. I didn’t feel like
going into the record store and instead walked over to the Gap, next to the
entrance of Robinson’s, which anchored the south end of the mall—I wasn’t
hungry anymore or maybe I was too stunned to notice. Down under where
the lights are low—the Devo song was still in my head as I stared into the
Gap, not knowing where to go or what to do. I’m not sure how long I stood in
front of the store, dazed and immobile, trying to formulate a plan for the rest
of the afternoon and that night, when I realized a floating presence in the
near-empty mall and I reoriented myself: Robert Mallory materialized behind
me, his image reflected in the window I was staring into. I don’t know why I
wasn’t afraid or didn’t recoil. I simply turned and faced him.
“Oh, hey,” Robert said, feigning surprise at seeing me. “I thought that
was you.”
“Hey,” I said, playing along, keeping everything even.
“And that was you, right?” he asked grinning. “Following me?”
“I wasn’t following you,” I said, innocently. “I was heading to the
Galleria and I happened to be behind you, I guess.” I pretended to be
confused. “You were in the Porsche, right?”
“I know, yeah, that was me,” he said. “I was just fucking with you.” He
reached out and lightly punched me on the shoulder. I refrained from
flinching. “I don’t like being followed.”
“Yeah?” I asked. “You don’t like being followed?”
“Yeah,” he said, looking around the mall. “It freaks me out.”
“What are you doing here?” I asked, trying to sound natural.
“I need to buy some clothes,” he said, gesturing at the Robinson’s
entrance, and with the mock formality of a game-show host asked, “And
what brings you to the Galleria on this Tuesday afternoon?” Without waiting
for me to answer he added, lowering his voice, almost conspiratorially,
“There are a lot of hot girls here.”
I floundered and landed on: “I was going to see a movie.”
“Oh yeah?” he asked, briefly animated. “What movie?”
“Well, turns out I’ve seen them all, so—”
“Maybe The Shining?” he asked in a fake ghoulish voice, raising his
eyebrows, grinning wolfishly.
I had to admit this disarmed me—the fact that he brought this up made
me trust him. It was part of the seduction—he was a con man. I smiled even
though I didn’t want to. “You sure you weren’t there?” I felt helpless asking
this—but the desire overrode rationality.
“Dude, you’ve got to let that go—”
“But I’m pretty sure I saw you, Robert.” I uselessly stood my ground.
“I might have been in L.A. but I haven’t seen that movie,” he said,
bewildered by my insistence. “Was I that unforgettable?” he asked,
mimicking someone fey, a pansy, lifting a limp wrist. But then he was
grinning like a movie star, and though the question was supposed to make fun
of me it was said without any real malice. It was just because his
handsomeness was so unnerving that briefly suggesting something about me
that he didn’t know—that I might be gay and desired him—was painful. And
yet the pain emboldened me.
“What were you talking to Matt Kellner about?” I asked. “Do you know
him?”
“Who?” He appeared to be genuinely confused.
“Matt. Kellner,” I said. “You were talking to him in the parking lot after
school.”
“Oh. Yeah?” Robert paused. “You saw that?”
“Yeah,” I said. “As I was walking to my car.”
“Are you guys…friends?” He asked this with a barely pronounced
slyness.
“Is that an innuendo?” I asked and realized I sounded too defensive.
“Yeah, we’re friends.”
“Is that a what?” Robert asked, again confused.
“Nothing, forget it.”
“Innuendo about?”
“Were you implying something?” I asked. “About me and Matt?”
“Implying?” he asked, and then changed direction. “Why didn’t you
come over and say hi?”
“Didn’t want to interrupt the conversation,” I said, trying to act casual.
“It seemed like you guys were really into it, having a deep talk about
something.”
The three faces suddenly appeared, lured by me, and I saw the manic
cycling behind Robert’s eyes. There was the mask, and then there was the
dangerously ill person behind the mask that we didn’t know about yet and
then there was the face that was looking at the scene from a wide angle, a
master shot, trying to figure out what would calm this nervous and inquisitive
boy standing in front of him.
“Yeah…” he started haltingly. “We have a…vague family connection.”
“Really?” I said. “A family connection?”
“Yeah, but he didn’t know anything about it,” Robert said. “My aunt’s ex
worked with his dad. Matt seems like a pretty confused guy.”
“He’s just very easygoing, laid back,” I said lamely.
“So, wait, Thom is Susan Reynolds’s boyfriend?” he asked. “They’re
seeing each other?”
Something dropped in me. “Yeah,” I said, suddenly freezing.
“How long?” he asked, staring.
“What?” I asked, staring back at him, shocked that he’d be asking me
this.
“How long have they been dating?” he asked. “How long have they been
together?”
“About two years,” I said in a hollow voice.
He took this in, nodded to himself while scanning the mall,
contemplating the information. “So,” he started, looking back at me, “she’s
serious.” He paused. “About him.” It wasn’t a question.
Actually I wanted to say Thom was more serious than Susan, but I didn’t
say anything, just nodded my head slowly affirming this. I didn’t want to
prolong the conversation but I also couldn’t stop myself.
“Why are you asking me this?” I said. “They’ve been serious for two
years now.”
He shrugged. “She’s hot,” he said. “Quite the little honey.”
I remember those words and the way he said them exactly. I had never
heard a girl referred to in that way: the little honey.
“Yeah, she’s very pretty,” I said. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I had to get
away from Robert Mallory and everything emanating from his presence.
“Okay, well, I gotta go.”
“Yeah.” He thumbed the entrance to Robinson’s. “Gotta get some
threads.”
“Okay, yeah,” I said. “Well, okay, I gotta go.”
“Are you all right?” he suddenly asked with a concern that felt—like
everything else about him—borrowed, fake.
“Oh yeah, yeah,” I said. “I’m fine. See you tomorrow.”
Robert wasn’t ready to say goodbye yet. He was staring at me, trying to
understand the individual in front of him—was I a friend, was I an enemy,
could I be trusted, would he have to play games with me, what was my story
exactly. He wasn’t offended or angry—just curious. I made a motion with my
hands: Is there something else?
“I just figured something out about you,” he said, nodding slowly.
“Yeah, I just figured something out about you, Bret.”
I tried to smile. “Yeah? What did you just figure out?”
He paused for emphasis. “When you talk to me you’re really talking to
yourself, dude,” he murmured and then quickly smiled as if this was a casual
and natural observation even though it was clearly meant to unmoor me—it
was a tease. But I laughed politely, because I had nothing left to say.
Confused, I immediately walked away from him and thought I was going to
pass out from hunger and went straight to McDonald’s on the second floor of
the mall and ordered a Big Mac and large fries and ate them ravenously while
sitting alone. When I headed out of the Galleria about fifteen minutes later I
saw Robert Mallory in the deserted mall, just a lone figure with a blank
expression, a handsome teenage boy in a private-school uniform, standing in
front of a particular storefront on the first floor and staring intently into the
glass windows: it was the mall’s pet shop, called Vince’s Pets.
—
AT THE EMPTY HOUSE ON MULHOLLAND I waited for Ryan Vaughn
to call me but he never did. So I called the house in Northridge and hung up
when his father answered—I realized I’d need to schedule with Ryan during
the day so he’d know when to pick up my calls, though I’m sure he’d want to
know why I didn’t just ask George if I might speak to his son—Please, don’t
be a pussy, I heard Ryan admonish me yet again. I couldn’t really concentrate
on anything because of Robert Mallory—lust mixed with dread—and I
ignored two phone calls from Debbie and zoned out in the Jacuzzi, muttering
to myself, and then took a scalding shower. When you talk to me you’re
really talking to yourself, dude, repeated in my mind as I sat at my desk, the
Olivetti humming in front of me, while I stared out the bay window at the
San Fernando Valley beyond the backyard framed by eucalyptus trees. I
finally shook off the stupor and was rereading the pages I’d typed when the
phone rang. It was after nine and I thought it was Ryan and since I knew he
would never leave a message I picked up. Happy Days and then Laverne and
Shirley had played, and now Three’s Company, all with the sound turned off
because they were reruns due to the recent Writers Guild strike. Instead of
Ryan I heard another voice.
“Bret, it’s Steven Reinhardt,” the voice said. “I hope it’s not too late but I
have Terry Schaffer calling.”
“What?” I asked, confused. “You mean Debbie.”
“Um, no, Terry’s calling you,” Steven said. “Hold, please.” And then I
heard: “Hey, Bret, it’s Terry.” He said this in a casual way, as if Terry calling
at nine o’clock on a school night was cool, and immediately asked in a low
voice, “What are you wearing?”
I was shocked but used to it. “Very funny,” I said, blushing. I could have
told him I was wearing only jockey shorts but decided against it, afraid of
where that might take the conversation. “Just joking, just kidding,” he said. I
heard ice clinking in a glass and noted the nasal quality of Terry’s voice as he
commanded something to Billie, the golden retriever, who barked lightly
twice in the room Terry was in, and then quieted down. He asked, “How are
you?” He sounded smoothly professional, on top of things, despite the
alcohol and what I supposed was cocaine.
“I’m fine, I’m fine,” I said. I stood up from the desk and began nervously
pacing the room. My face was reddened and I had to contain the wavering in
my voice. I did this by lowering it. I couldn’t figure out why Terry was
calling me.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“I’m…” I stammered. “I’m doing homework.” I shrugged to no one else
in the room.
A pause. “Well, I hope I’m not interrupting—”
“No, no, not at all, Terry—”
“Look, I heard that Liz accosted you the other night,” Terry said. “And
I’m very sorry about that. Steven told me. I’m mortified.”
I was suddenly relieved. “Oh, it’s fine,” I said. “I hope she’s okay.”
“Well, we all want her to get better,” Terry said diplomatically. “But she
has to want that herself. And she doesn’t seem to think there’s a problem.”
He paused. “As of yet.”
I stayed silent. I didn’t know what to say.
“Steven told me you were very gentle and understanding with her,”
Terry said. “And I appreciate that.”
“She didn’t really accost me…” I murmured.
“And I’d like to show you my appreciation,” he said, not listening. “I’d
like to get to know you a little better. Debbie tells me you’re a writer. I didn’t
know this. She says you’re working on a book.”
Everything—all the tension—dissolved. I was flattered. My face was
burning.
“Would you be interested in writing scripts?” he asked casually.
I heard the clinking of ice in the pause that followed.
“Yeah, sure,” I said. This suggestion—I rewrote it as an offer—
immediately excited me.
“You like movies, right?” he asked. I could hear the flirtation in his tone.
“Yeah, definitely.”
“Well, I’m always looking for fresh voices,” Terry said. “It’s an exciting
time for young people,” he offered blandly. “But their stories aren’t told well
enough. Slasher flicks, sex comedies. Dumb stuff.”
“Yeah,” I said though I liked sex comedies and slasher movies. “I
guess.”
“Maybe you can come up with something,” he said. “If you have any
ideas maybe we could meet.” He paused. “And you could pitch me
something.”
“Yeah, sure, Terry,” I said. “That would be great.”
“Okay,” he said. “And again—thanks about Liz.”
There was a pause that indicated the conversation wasn’t over yet and
then Terry lightly cleared his throat and said, “Deborah doesn’t need to know
about this.”
“About what?”
He stopped, as if he had overstepped a boundary, as if he was making a
mistake.
“About me calling you,” he said, clarifying. “You don’t need to tell
Debbie.”
“Oh, yeah,” I said. “Oh, right, of course. Yeah.” At first I didn’t know
why Terry thought this was important but I went along with it. I didn’t want
to displease him. And then I wondered if Steven Reinhardt was on the phone,
listening in.
“Yeah?” Terry asked, relieved. “That’s cool?”
“Oh yeah, yeah,” I said. “I won’t say anything.”
“Good night, Bret,” Terry Schaffer said.
There was a click and then the phone call was over.

I WAS TOO keyed up to concentrate on homework or read the Stephen King
book or watch lame sitcoms I’d already seen, so I looked through a couple of
straight porn tapes I occasionally jerked off to that I’d bought from Jeff
Taylor. I played them on the Betamax beneath the TV directly across from
the king-sized bed, where I’d prop myself up against the pillows
masturbating while under the spell of a young Joey Silvera, who had a lean
and handsome face with wide brown eyes and a slightly sleazy mustache but
with an idealized body—tall and bronzed, a flat stomach and abs, a tan line
and a big cock with a brown bush. The three tapes Silvera starred in were
from the late 1970s: Babyface, Extremes and my favorite, Expensive Tastes,
where a group of men, along with a woman, plot and execute a series of
rapes. It was directed by a woman, which might be why Joey Silvera was, at
least to me, so idealized as a physical object—he’s by far the hottest guy in
the movie and whoever was shooting this knew it. There’s a scene where one
of the rapists, all in ski masks, sucks Joey off during the gang rape of
Silvera’s own girlfriend and it was agonizingly erotic for me when I first
watched it even though we find out later that it’s actually a woman, and that
Joey Silvera is actually part of the group as well: this is just a ritual that turns
them all on and the masked, supposedly male, cohort sucking him off gives
Silvera a reason not to go to the police because he’s too ashamed to admit he
was sucked off by a dude—he argues to his raped girlfriend, seemingly
anguished. I masturbated that night to images of Joey—there were two that
almost always got me off—and then took a Valium, which moved me into a
fast and dreamless sleep but not before I fantasized about Terry Schaffer and
my future. I knew he wanted something from me and there would probably
be a quid pro quo I’d have to deal with when the moment came but I’d worry
about that when it happened. I was seventeen and the future had opened up
considerably that night—Terry Schaffer wanted me to write a script for him.
There was a way out of the trap, I realized. This was an escape from the
pantomime. Terry’s call confirmed I had plans, I was mapping out my own
destiny, I was a writer.

THAT WEEK IN SEPTEMBER passed in a blur—Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday remained hazy and indistinct. We all followed the rules and acted
accordingly, wore our uniforms and attended classes, arrived at school and
wheeled our cars into parking spaces and walked across the pavement to the
bell tower and entered the campus beyond it, but I was self-imprisoned in my
own world, creating a new narrative for myself, even as I tried to be positive
and upbeat. For example, that week I got used to the idea, the belief, that
whatever happened to the statue of the Griffin was a harmless prank that
simply took a ghoulish turn unintended, and that whoever held the flashlight
in the courtyard of the library on that Monday night realized things had
gotten out of hand and regretted it, and I believed that Robert Mallory was
sane and no less stable than anyone else in the senior class, and that we were
all innocent and safe, protected by privilege and linked together by status and
class and our parents’ ambitions for us. But I also had increasingly not been a
part of Buckley and I was resisting the integration of myself into the stream
of high-school life. I felt a profound disconnection for the first time that
lightly touched everything I came into contact with. And I realized I was no
longer the tangible participant in not only the life of Buckley but in the
outside world as well. Nothing seemed to affect me. I had become numb.
—
FOR EXAMPLE, I didn’t care that Ronald Reagan had been elected
president last November—this meant absolutely nothing to me at seventeen
and politics have stayed that way for the rest of my life. I’d paid attention
when he was shot in March, returning to his limousine after a speaking
engagement at the Washington Hilton, by John Hinckley, who had committed
the assassination attempt to impress the actress Jodie Foster, but like
everything else it didn’t really register. It was empty excitement. I knew the
details but didn’t attach anything to them: feelings or meaning.
For example, I might have been too young to fully appreciate John
Lennon’s artistry as a Beatle or a solo performer but his murder at the hands
of a deranged fan didn’t have the same shock effect on me as it did to my
older classmates and last December I pretended it upset me far more than it
actually had and acted appropriately melodramatic, playing Double Fantasy
more than I wanted to—I always thought it was mediocre even though
devastated mourners assured me there was greatness in it now that Lennon
was dead.
For example, that following January of 1981 I drifted through a trip to
New Orleans with my father and Thom Wright to attend the Super Bowl
though I had no interest in football (Thom Wright did, of course, being the
Griffins’ quarterback) and I didn’t even know what teams were playing
against each other in the Louisiana Superdome that Sunday afternoon.
Thom’s dad, Lionel, had flown in from New York and the four of us stayed at
the Ritz-Carlton, where I shared a room with Thom, and though I was
alienated enough not to be able to tell you what teams played (it was the
Oakland Raiders versus the Philadelphia Eagles) I can remember with the
intensity of a brightly lit snapshot Thom changing in front of me in the suite
we shared and briefly glimpsing him naked, coming out of the bathroom in a
Ritz-Carlton robe after taking a shower, and just idly talking to me as he
slipped the robe off, turning demurely so I wouldn’t see his dick when he
slipped on a pair of jockey shorts as I watched the white cotton stretch over
his perfect ass—I had seen a variation of this many times in the boys’ locker
room at Buckley but it seemed so much more intimate in a hotel suite far
from Los Angeles—it felt, just very briefly, something could have happened,
though I wasn’t delusional enough to pretend my desire would be
reciprocated by Thom. But I remember that image more than the game itself,
where we sat high above the field in a VIP booth complete with a full bar and
where Thom and I ordered shrimp cocktails and were allowed to drink
Michelobs and a number of men came up to say hello to both my father and
Lionel Wright. The Iran hostage crisis had just ended—there was a pregame
ceremony honoring this—and the Superdome had been wrapped in a giant
yellow ribbon to show solidarity with the hostages (the country had been
strewn with yellow ribbons for what seemed like years) and yet I was more
interested in the perfection of Thom Wright’s ass than anything else on that
trip. Though I remember we met the NBC anchorman Dick Enberg, and then
Bryant Gumbel, who would be interviewing me on the Today show four
years later, the summer Less Than Zero was published. I was numb to
everything except for a flash of nudity in an anonymous hotel suite.
For example, celebratory events that meant something to the world at
large failed to ignite my interest: The royal wedding between Prince Charles
and Lady Diana happened in July and I never watched a minute of it as the
ceremony aired across the globe—Susan and Debbie were hooked to the
spectacle. The lack of engagement from the no longer tangible participant, I
noted, was vast and spreading. Sex and novels and music and movies were
the things that made life bearable—not friends, not family, not school, not
social scenes, not interactions—and that was the summer when I watched
Raiders of the Lost Ark every other week but barely had dinner with my
separated parents even twice. I had no stakes in the real world—why would
I? It wasn’t built for me or my needs or desires. And I was reminded of this
almost constantly since I was locked in a teenage horniness skyrocketing into
the stratosphere and constantly activated by things I found erotic—and yet
could never have. This was my only point of reference. This was what
contributed to the no longer tangible participant.
—
MAYBE I DON’T REMEMBER that first week because I realized that
senior year was going to become a struggle and that I’d need to resort to a
kind of cunning to get through it and this distracted me further from my dayto-day reality. But it was really just a quiet week: students were adjusting to a
new year back, and Buckley made it easy for everyone—it pampered you and
made you feel safe and that you not only mattered but were important. The
days just evaporated. I only went to classes. I hadn’t joined the Buckley
literary magazine (two issues a year) or The Buckley Gazette (biweekly) and
there was an endless list of extracurricular activities I never neared: the drama
club, the backpacking club, the biology club, the dance club, the cooking
club, among dozens of others. I remained the proud underachiever. The
things that happened the first week that I remember had nothing to do with
me—there was fallout from a racist skit that had been performed by Doug
Furth and David O’Shea in Señora Ipolita’s Spanish III class; we found out
that the Algebra teacher, Mrs. Susskind, was getting a divorce; one of the bus
drivers died at her home from a heart attack; there’d been a fire in a utility
shed on the sports field. I also remember that Robert Mallory didn’t join us
for lunch at the center table beneath the Pavilion that first week—he was
testing out other groups, sizing up their possibilities, and it also seemed to me
as if he was purposefully staying away from Susan Reynolds. I glimpsed
Robert eating with Matt Kellner on that Thursday but neither of them was
saying anything to the other: Matt was wearing a Walkman, sunning himself,
eyes shut; Robert cross-legged next to him reading a paperback. It wasn’t
until Debbie demanded that we hang out Friday night at my place with Thom
and Susan that I suddenly woke up, and paid attention to the reality of my
situation: I had to get un-numb, I had to play the part better.
—
BUT DEBBIE HAD TO MOVE the get-together with Susan and Thom from
Friday to Saturday because a rockabilly band called the Stray Cats was
playing at the Roxy on Friday. I had no desire but not because I didn’t like
the band: we’d listened to their U.K. import produced by Dave Edmunds a lot
that summer before their American debut was released the following year.
Even though the song “Rock This Town” was being played on KROQ the
Stray Cats didn’t have a record deal in the United States and I didn’t go to the
Roxy that Friday night—even though Debbie promised me there’d be a lot of
celebrities and we’d hang out upstairs after the show—because this gave me
the opportunity to see Ryan Vaughn instead. I didn’t call Ryan that Thursday
afternoon I found out about the Stray Cats concert because he was at football
practice and instead waited for the allotted time we’d agreed upon earlier that
day, when we were having lunch, and he picked up the phone at seven,
amused that I was so prompt. I’d hoped Ryan would want to get together and
spend Friday night at the house on Mulholland with me, but there was
“something” the following morning with his mom and dad and younger
brother he couldn’t get out of and he didn’t tell me what it was and I didn’t
ask—I imagined it was religious, church-related. “What about Saturday
night?” he asked. “Your parents are out of town, right?” This suggestion put
me into an automatic erotic trance. “I could be there around six…” He trailed
off. And then I realized that the plans with Debbie and Susan and Thom had
been moved because of the concert so I invited Ryan to come for dinner and
hang out with us on Saturday night and when everyone left he could stay over
and the two of us could spend Sunday together, maybe he’d even sleep over
on Sunday night as well. Since there were no new movies that weekend
Westwood wasn’t really an option, so we could spend all day lying by the
pool. How did that sound?
“That’s a little…ambitious,” Ryan said cautiously, as if he was glancing
around the room he was standing in. “That’s a little too much. And I don’t
really want to hang out with that group.” He added this quietly, in a low
voice.
“You like me, you like Thom,” I said. “It would only be for dinner.”
“Thom’s okay,” Ryan said, noncommittal.
“He thinks you’re great,” I said, trying to soften his hardness.
“He’s not that smart.”
“That’s not true.”
“Maybe Sunday. We can hang out.” Ryan paused. “I want to see you. I
think about you.”
“I think about you, too.”
“But for this to work…uh, requires a certain amount of, um, subterfuge,”
he said slyly, as if this was a game we were playing. “Do you understand?”
“Why do you sound like a spy from a 1940s movie?” I asked.
“I’m just…practical,” he said. I liked the subtle sexiness in his voice.
“Yeah,” I said, nodding to no one, alone in my bedroom. “I get it, but—”
“I gotta go,” he said. “Talk. To. Ya. Later.” He made a reference to the
Tubes song that had been popular earlier that year. There was a click.
I thought I had fucked up. In my frustration I was going to cancel
Saturday night with Debbie and Thom and Susan and then call Ryan back,
when Thom suddenly called and told me that instead of going for sushi at the
Japanese place in the Glen Centre, about a mile down the road from the house
on Mulholland (I didn’t even know that had been part of the plan), Susan and
Debbie decided to order pizza from Santo Pietro’s—and that’s what we’d be
doing Saturday night. “But why are we doing this?” I blurted out, frustrated.
“What do you mean?” Thom asked. “What is this get-together about?” I
wailed. Thom said that Susan wanted to talk to us about something, a party
she was throwing—didn’t I know about this, she thought it would be fun if
we all planned it together, that’s all, what’s your problem? “Is everything
okay, Bret?” Thom’s calm, almost plaintive question, filled with an innate
sense of care, made me realize that everything was, in fact, fine and that I
actually did want to see everyone, my friends, Saturday night and I was
relieved they were coming over. I’d deal with Ryan on Sunday, I hoped.
And on that Friday night I typed up five pages of Less Than Zero
(though these pages wouldn’t appear in the published version) and then
heated up the enchiladas Rosa had prepared for me, finished reading Cujo
(the kid died—I was impressed and shocked; Stephen King had balls) and
then watched Joey Silvera in a scene from Expensive Tastes. The two new
premieres on the Z Channel were Flash Gordon and Roman Polanski’s Tess,
and I’d already seen both in theaters last December. I couldn’t sleep and I
ended up driving through the canyons while playing a song I’d become
haunted by, B-Movie’s “Nowhere Girl,” which always put me in a strange
and heightened mood, a kind of spell, I entered a film—it was a piano-driven
minor-key New Wave song, faraway and ethereal, doomy and lightly
propulsive, and it would aid in whipping me along the desolate streets in the
Mercedes convertible, making the loneliness of my world seem thrilling,
something to embrace and covet. The emptiness and the numbness I felt were
feelings whenever I heard the song, and the song also applied to Julie Selwyn
and wherever she had disappeared to that summer, twirling on the dance floor
at the Seven Seas, in a video, fading into the strobe. I drove late that night
listening to “Nowhere Girl” over and over while I traced Mulholland and a
deserted Sepulveda, zooming up Beverly Glen and back to the lit house on
the cliff side overlooking the Valley, until I was tired enough to finally fall
asleep and dropped onto the bed exhausted, ignoring the messages Debbie
left on the answering machine whenever her calls awakened me in the middle
of the night.
—
IT WAS FOUR O’CLOCK on that Saturday in September when I heard the
doorbell. Since Debbie and Thom and Susan weren’t coming over until six I
walked to the foyer with mild trepidation—for a flash I imagined hopefully
that it was Ryan—that he had changed his mind, he’d come to surprise me—
and the fantasy was momentarily exciting until I thought maybe it was the
Trawler, someone wearing a black ski mask in broad daylight clenching a
knife in a gloved fist, not caring, waiting for me to open the door, slavering, I
was next. But when I looked through the viewing hole I saw Debbie, alone,
wearing Wayfarers, impatiently standing there, grim-faced, the BMW in the
driveway behind her. I paused before opening the door, realizing something
was wrong. I wondered where Susan and Thom were. Debbie rang the
doorbell again, startling me. I opened the door. Debbie didn’t say anything as
she passed across the foyer and into the kitchen, where she pulled a pink can
of Tab out of the refrigerator and then opened the sliding glass door and
walked out to one of the chaises arranged by the pool. Shingy followed her
and was jumping around excitedly as she just sat on the edge of the chaise,
ignoring the dog, and contemplated the blue, still water through her
sunglasses.
“O-kay,” I said to myself as she lit a clove cigarette, not looking back at
the house.
Debbie expected me to follow her but I was resentful that she’d arrived
on Mulholland earlier than she told me. I had planned to work out in the
makeshift gym next to the garage and then jerk off, go for a swim and reread
what I had written yesterday before Thom and Susan and Debbie arrived. But
that was not going to happen, I realized sourly as I stared at Debbie through
the sliding glass doors, knowing she was in a bad mood and I was the target,
and I resented it. Instead of going outside and playing her version of the
scene I walked through the kitchen and down the hallway to my bedroom. I
turned on the TV and sat at my desk thinking things through. The door
leading out to the deck was open and there were no sounds coming from the
yard, which contributed to the annoying suspense of the moment. I waited
fifteen minutes, until I finally heard footsteps on the veranda leading to my
room. I realized futilely this had been a contest that I won. Debbie walked
across the deck, sunglasses pushed up against her forehead, Shingy
following, still curious and excited by her presence. Debbie sounded
confused, low-level angry. “Hello? Bret? Hello?”
“I’m in here,” I called out. She finally stood in the doorway but didn’t
come in. I remained at my desk, in front of the typewriter.
“Why are you in here?” she asked. “Why didn’t you come outside?”
“I thought you…wanted to be alone,” was how I played it.
This ticked her off. “Why would I come over here if I wanted to be
alone?”
“You’re early,” I said. “Is something wrong?”
“You’re not happy to see me?” she asked. “You’re not excited to see
me? You’re asking your girlfriend if something’s wrong?”
“You’re just early,” I shrugged. “I wasn’t expecting you until six.”
“We’ve got to clear something up,” she said. “I need to know where you
are.”
“Where I am?” I pretended to be confused even though I knew exactly
what she was getting at.
“Do you like me?”
This came out hard and fast, more of a declaration than a question, and I
didn’t have to act surprised because I legitimately was.
“Very much,” I said, stunned. “But if you’re asking that you must think I
don’t and that’s a problem.”
She wasn’t convinced but she softened, and from where she was standing
she looked around the room as if searching for something. Rosa didn’t come
on Saturdays, so my bed was unmade and a T-shirt and a pair of tennis shorts
and a towel were strewn next to it. And then she saw what she was looking
for: the answering machine blinking on the nightstand next to the bed. Debbie
shifted her stance and looked at me accusingly. I knew the messages were
hers because I heard Debbie leaving them at midnight and one o’clock and
two-fifteen, but I hadn’t picked up, just groaned, pushing a pillow over my
head, and fell back asleep. But the blinking light proved to her that I hadn’t
played them yet and therefore confirmed I hadn’t heard her when, in fact, I
actually had as she was leaving the messages. She bit her lip, contemplating
something.
“How serious are you?” she asked.
“Why are you asking me this?”
“Because you’ve been a frigging zombie this past week.”
“No, I haven’t,” I said automatically. And then, realizing, “I’m sorry.”
“A zombie. A fucking zombie. I really don’t know what’s wrong with
you.”
She realized she was being uselessly harsh, so she softened again. “Talk
to me.” She paused. “I need you to be honest with me.”
“Honest about what?”
“I need your reassurance. No bullshit.”
“You need my reassurance?” I asked. “About what?”
“About us,” she said. “God, you’re such a zombie.”
“You’re just saying things,” I said. “You’re just talking. None of it’s
making sense. You need my reassurance?”
“I need your reassurance, Bret, about us.”
For a very brief moment I was on the verge of admitting something to
her—a truth, my real feelings. But then I realized with an acid awareness that
I didn’t want to complicate the year because everything had been set up, the
narrative was in play, we were already enacting our roles; there was nowhere
else to go—and I wanted to keep hiding the real Bret. I intuited this year was
going to be a bummer in so many ways that I actually needed the pretend
safety of Debbie’s structured world so I could get to June. In that moment it
was simply the easiest path: there wasn’t another alternative. I was going to
be the attentive boyfriend. The pragmatist was going to try and become the
tangible participant once again. “I really like you,” I told her—and this was
true, this was real and not a lie. “You know how I am,” I said, shrugging.
“Susan says you have secrets.”
“That’s just a game we play.”
“Are we playing a game?”
“I’m not playing a game.”
“You’re either with me or you’re not,” she said.
“I’m with you.”
“I don’t want to trap you but I need to know.”
“You’re amazing. You’re beautiful. I’m just distracted. I’m just out of it,
you know that—”
“I hate asking this, Bret. I hate being put in this position—”
“You’re putting yourself in this position—”
“—because you should just, I don’t know, be into me, Bret. Or not.
Maybe you’re into someone else. Are you into someone else?”
“No, no—”
“Because if you are just tell me.”
“I swear I’m not.”
She stared at me—the anger was replaced with longing.
“Hey, baby,” I said. “Come here.”
She pouted, it was both real and exaggerated, like so many aspects of
Debbie, and then she walked over to me and automatically slid onto my lap. I
wrapped my arms around her tightly in an embrace.
“You know I get distracted,” I said softly. “I get lost in my own world. I
get lost in my book. You’ve known this about me since we were kids—how
spacy I can get. You’ve always known this about me.”
“You just seemed so totally spacy this last week,” she said quietly.
“We’ve barely hung out.” She kissed me. I gave her my tongue and then
pulled back but not in a teasing way.
“Hey,” I said softly again. “How was the show last night? How were the
Stray Cats?”
“Fun,” she said. “I wished you’d come. They’re going to be big. They
have a deal with EMI,” I remember she said before trailing off and kissing
me again.
We led each other to the unmade bed and fell onto it and my lips became
sticky with strawberry gloss and then I was on top of her and she wrapped her
legs around my waist, grinding into me, while I tried concentrating on the sex
and focused on what I was supposed to be doing, making sure my actions and
movements were tinged with the requisite lust. But I was distracted because
Debbie liked to move fast and she took over quickly, as she usually did, and
then I was lying on my back and pulling my T-shirt over my head while she
pulled my shorts and underwear all the way off and flung them to the floor.
She lifted her Camp Beverly Hills T-shirt, revealing those incredibly perfect
breasts, pink and firm with small stiff nipples the color of cotton candy, while
riding me, hands pressing down on my chest as she balanced herself, leaning
over and kissing me again, and then she maneuvered out of her shorts and
panties until she was fully naked above me, riven with lust. The fantasy we
were creating almost cracked for me because of how real it seemed to her.
And I realized that in order for this to work I had to stop thinking Debbie
deserved someone better. I had to believe that she deserved me.
—
THE KNOWN FACT: Debbie Schaffer was the hottest girl at Buckley—she
wasn’t the classic beauty that Susan Reynolds embodied but she was the
fantasy boys jerk off to, dream of naked, fucking. She was Penthouse, a
Vargas Girl, the cover of Candy-O, she was the teen boys’ ideal, a porn star,
any guy would’ve been extremely lucky to have her, to the degree that I
believed someone would kill in a testosterone-fueled rage to be able to have
her and only once, to instill the memory of that one fuck in order to save their
own pathetic life and give it meaning. Add to this she was smart—Debbie
wasn’t an airhead, as if this even mattered compared to the power of her
physicality. So why was I her boyfriend? I had gone through the usual
adolescent problems: I’d never had braces but I gained weight after eighth
grade while staying with my grandfather in Nevada that summer: too many
unsupervised vanilla milkshakes and cheeseburgers in the coffee shop at one
of the hotels he owned in Elko and visits to the drugstore on Main Street to
buy a bag of candy that would take me through the night. I didn’t lose it
entirely until the end of ninth grade and then regained it briefly in tenth, until
I lost it again in eleventh, but the proof would always be there in terrible
yearbook photos taken at the beginning of our junior year. I’d had a few
awkward haircuts, light acne that luckily vanished completely before tenth
grade began with the help of an expensive dermatologist in Beverly Hills, but
I had insecurity issues even after my transformation junior year because I
never felt I was in Thom Wright’s league or as good-looking and athletic as
Ryan Vaughn or even as hot as Matt Kellner. But it turned out that into
eleventh and twelfth grade I was actually quite close—though I realized this
fully much later on. I just hadn’t liked myself enough, and the attendant aloof
attitude never endeared me to anyone. In retrospect I realized—in fact I was
told—that there were many girls who liked me whenever I shed the weight
but the elusive vibe I gave off was intimidating. Don’t touch me there, the
Tubes sang out in one of my favorite songs—the mock-1960s parody lyrics
were about a woman who wasn’t ready for sex, but to me it had become a
metaphor about my own alienation.
What did Deborah see in me that she didn’t see in anyone else during
that moment, I kept wondering—did she see a version of Terry and was she
trying to figure something out about her father through me or was that overly
complicating her simple desires? I realized early on that my distance and
supposed spaciness implied to Debbie that I was just another clueless dude
and this had worked to my advantage over the summer. I had assumed, on a
certain level, that I was cooler than everybody; the truth was that Debbie
made me cooler than I really was. But I was confused: Debbie was a rich girl
who took advantage of her wealth and seemingly did whatever she wanted,
completely ignoring and unencumbered by the realities of the world (even
though she was aware that her mother was an alcoholic and, I supposed, that
her father was gay), and as she increasingly moved toward the edges of, I
don’t know how else to put it, the trappings of a rock-and-roll lifestyle and
the bands and men that attracted her, I was, by comparison, a fairly clean-cut
option, a preppie WASP, almost square. I could have easily passed as a dude
in a fraternity or a member of the Young Republican National Federation; in
fact all the guys at Buckley our senior year resembled this: Thom, Ryan, Jeff,
Matt. And I was surprised Debbie found me, of all people, as sexy as she did.
Debbie was actually hip and hungry for experience in ways that I simply
wasn’t and I knew so little about her, I realized over the summer of 1981. I
never wanted her to come off as desperate and needy but I now had to take
responsibility: I had created this version of Debbie Schaffer in the summer
before our senior year and I hated the way she transformed because of her
feelings for me—her desire and frustration were real and intertwined and it
was all my fault, the false vibes I emanated only encouraged her lust. I was
the secretive and not entirely trustworthy boyfriend, the cad, not the bad boy
exactly, but the boy who wasn’t there, the incredible shrinking boy. She
deserved someone better than me.
—
DEBBIE HAD TAKEN COMPLETE CONTROL and was grinding on my
dick, which unlike Sunday night in her bedroom had gotten fully stiff. My
hands reached for her breasts and she encouraged me to lightly run my palms
over her nipples, and she was moaning how good it felt. She guided me in—
we never wore condoms—and it amazed me how quickly she came: it was
within minutes of me thrusting into her while she fingered her clitoris that I
felt her clenching around my cock. And then she urged me to come as I kept
thrusting, straining to ejaculate, and anxiety that I wasn’t going to be able to
maintain the erection caused me to pull out and start jerking myself off, eyes
closed, thinking about Matt Kellner naked and wet, on his knees sucking my
cock as I leaned against a wall in the pool house, while Debbie kissed me,
massaging my balls as I kept stroking myself. And then she pushed my hand
away and started deep throating my penis until it was slathered with her
saliva and I saw Ryan’s spread ass above my face as we sucked each other
off in a 69 position while I tried to tongue his smooth pink butthole on that
afternoon in August, and then it was Matt again and I remembered how
intensely I’d made him orgasm on Monday. I started breathing harder,
tensing up, I didn’t think I was going to be able to come but I found myself
lifting my head and nodding at her, unexpectedly climaxing while thrusting
into her mouth, my legs wide open, ejaculating as she kept jerking off the
shaft, half of the penis in her mouth, swallowing the semen that shot out of
me. She was grinning, pleased, and kissed me, and I smiled groggily at her
and tasted my own semen, remnants of it on her lips, on her tongue. What did
it matter, what did anything matter, nothing mattered, I realized, panting.
We walked naked to the Jacuzzi and sat in it quietly, listening to the
traffic on Mulholland while watching Shingy roam the expanse of lawn as the
light above us very slowly started changing, receding into a softer light, and
soon it was nearing six, the time when Thom and Susan were supposed to
come over.
We stayed silent in the Jacuzzi, and the only noise was just the sound of
the jets set on low, causing the water to lightly bubble, until she asked, “What
do you think of Robert?”
I thought about how to answer this and asked, “The new guy?”
“Do you listen to yourself?” she said, pretending to be shocked. “Do you
pay attention?” She moved closer to me, grinning. “Are we in the same
conversation?” She stared at me, amusingly bewildered. “Who else would I
possibly be talking about? Yes. Robert. The new guy, Bret.”
“Okay, okay,” I said, trying to smile back. “I’m sorry.”
“Don’t be sorry,” she said. “Just be, I don’t know, more present, babe.”
“Okay, the new guy, yes.” Debbie was straddling my lap, facing me, half
floating in the warm water. “What about him?”
“What do you think of him?” she asked.
“I don’t really…know him,” I said, not wanting to get into a
conversation about Robert Mallory.
“I think Susan likes him,” Debbie said, hoping to surprise me, pressing
lightly down on the word likes. I didn’t want to take the bait, I didn’t want to
go through that door with Debbie, and I ignored the comment.
“What about you?” I asked playfully, teasing her. “Huh? What about
you? What do you think of the new guy?”
She looked into my eyes, trying to figure something out, perhaps why I
wasn’t more curious with what she was suggesting about Susan. “Not really
my type.”
“I think he’s probably everyone’s type,” I said.
She pushed off me and floated on her back in the lightly bubbling water.
“I wouldn’t want to go out with a boy who was that much better-looking
than me,” Debbie said.
“Hey, thanks a lot,” I said, splashing at her.
“You know what I mean,” she said, squinting up at the fading sky. “Like
a model or whatever.” She paused. “It’s not my thing.”
“Susan likes him?” I asked. “How do you know?”
Debbie shrugged. It was evasive and held a meaning that she wanted me
to pursue and decipher but I didn’t want to follow through on that particular
story and so all I said was “I hope she behaves herself.”
Debbie, her eyes closed, smiled, nodding her head as she floated in the
water, her blond hair splayed out, and only said, “Let’s hope.”
—
I GOT DRUNK THAT SATURDAY. It started early on with beer and then
moved to champagne and by the end of the night I was doing shots of tequila
and snorting bumps of Debbie’s coke. But when Thom and Susan arrived I
was only mildly buzzed on a couple of Coronas Debbie and I were sharing
while listening to music in the living room—the Motels’ first record, with
“Total Control” on it—and then we were waiting for the pizza from Santo
Pietro’s to be delivered; Thom had ordered it about half an hour after they
arrived at six. There were two bottles of Mumm’s in the refrigerator, one that
Debbie and Susan opened; they poured themselves glasses and then walked
to the pool as the sky slowly faded into sunset, and smoked clove cigarettes,
talking quietly to each other, the Motels playing over the yard from outside
speakers, while Thom talked about when he would be leaving L.A. to look at
colleges with his dad during two bye weeks in the middle of football season.
The doorbell rang at around seven-thirty and Thom paid for the delivery and
brought it into the kitchen, where we prepped everything: I stacked some
plates and dumped the two salads into a wooden bowl while Thom opened
the pizza box and placed it on a tray we were going to take outside. I quickly
drank a glass of champagne and poured myself another, finishing the first
bottle off, and then opened the second. I looked out at the girls, now just in
silhouette against the pool’s blue light, misty tendrils of steam rising from the
Jacuzzi, and asked Thom, “What do you think they’re talking about?” Thom
glanced outside. “Probably us,” he said, with his brand of low-key
confidence. The girls didn’t want to eat by the pool—it was too warm, they
complained, and there were mosquitoes—so we decided to eat within the airconditioned comfort of the kitchen, where we sat around the large circular
table in the middle of the open room. Before we sat down Susan wanted me
to bring out candles and dim the lights, I guess to set a mood, and because of
this request I became uncertain about everything. I was a little tipsy from the
two glasses of champagne I’d quickly drunk and felt dizzy and nervous, and I
told Susan I wanted to keep all the lights in the house on. Someone asked
why.
“The home invasions,” I said. “The break-ins. There was another one last
Sunday night. In Century City.” I paused. “And two more this week.” I
paused again. “One in Rancho Park.” I breathed in and swallowed. “And one
in Culver City.”
Everyone was silent. No one had reached for the pizza yet. I noted their
confusion.
“Are the houses…dark when the home invasions happen?” Thom wanted
to know. “I mean is that why?”
I realized something. “I don’t know,” I said. “I guess not. I don’t know.”
“So—what difference does it make if the lights are on or off?” Thom
asked, hesitantly. Susan and Debbie were staring at me.
“Well, I’m assuming, with the lights on it’s a deterrent,” I said, dumbly.
“I haven’t heard anything about that,” Thom said. “I don’t think it
matters to whoever’s doing it. I mean if the lights are off or not.”
“They say people are targeted,” Debbie said unfazed, reaching for the
salad. “Do you feel you’ve been targeted, Bret? Do you think someone’s
coming to get you, baby?” She was humoring me but I was still slightly
afraid of what she was suggesting. Susan noticed that I flinched as I looked
nervously from Debbie to her and then back to Debbie.
“I know, it’s kind of scary,” Susan said, but she was lifting a slice of
pizza to her mouth and didn’t seem frightened at all.
“The last one was back in June,” I said, trying to explain something.
“And before that, January. I don’t know why they stopped for almost six
months. But now they’re happening again. Animals are missing.” I paused.
“Whoever’s doing it steals people’s pets, their cats, their dogs. It’s fucked
up.”
“That girl is still missing, too,” Deborah said, spearing a small wedge of
tomato. She looked up at all of our faces, blankly. “I mean I think that’s a
little more upsetting than someone’s missing cat.”
“Julie Selwyn,” I said. “It’s been almost eight weeks since she
disappeared,” I murmured, nodding to myself. “They’ve found nothing.” I
wondered aloud: “Do you think it’s connected?” I asked. “The break-ins and
Julie Selwyn?” I swallowed.
“What do you think happened to her?” Thom asked.
“Well,” I started, “I was hoping she ran away but the longer she’s
missing—”
“Guys, let’s stop trying to creep ourselves out,” Susan said, cutting me
off. “I want to talk about my party.” She laid her slice down after every bite
and then wiped her mouth, before picking the slice up again.
“Your party?” I said, trying to seem amused that this whimsy could
replace the dark seriousness of the home invasions, and forcing myself into a
different mood. I had already wolfed down a slice of pizza before the girls
came in and was just pouring myself another glass of champagne and I
should have been legitimately relaxed—the blow job, the orgasm, the
Jacuzzi, making up with Debbie, the Coronas that initially put me in a
mellow mood as well as being with my three best friends drinking my
parents’ expensive champagne—but I was keyed up, expectant, there was
something wrong about the tenor of the night, and what Susan and Thom
brought with them into the house on Mulholland. And then it was confirmed.
“Yes,” Susan said demurely. “I’m going to throw a party to welcome
Robert Mallory.”
She smiled at me and added, “It’s going to be at my house and I think we
should all throw it together. The four of us. To welcome him. We’ll invite
everyone in the senior class.”
I stared at Susan and felt strangely distanced, as if I was floating above
the kitchen, watching myself in a movie where I didn’t know the story, or
who my character was, what my lines were or how I was supposed to react to
the dialogue other people were reciting—I was just lost in it with nowhere to
go. I glanced over at Debbie, who was staring at Susan, waiting for her to
continue, looking a little bored. Thom was chewing a slice and washing it
down with Corona. “Yeah,” he said, confirming he was down with the party
while wiping his mouth with a napkin. I wanted to appear both completely
neutral and yet also aligned with the group. Since I was buzzed the possibility
to convey this emerged. “Totally awesome,” I said, but I couldn’t help myself
and asked: “Why?” And then I asked, “Why don’t you just throw a party and
invite him? What? It’s going to be, like, a theme party? Like a Welcome
Robert Mallory to Buckley party?” I hoped the confused expression,
bordering on a grimace, was registering without being too insistent or
overdone.
“It’s not exactly a theme party, Bret,” Susan said. “It’s not like he’s
going to know it’s for him.”
“I don’t get it,” I said.
“I think we should make him feel welcome,” Susan said. “I think he’s
had some hard times and I think he needs to feel welcome here.”
“What are the…hard times?” I asked with an inquisitive and caring voice
that I hoped hid the light level of disgust I felt about Susan throwing a party
for Robert Mallory.
She paused. She looked over at Thom, who nodded, and then at Debbie,
who shrugged. I realized uneasily that they all knew what the supposed hard
times were and that this information was now going to be directed at me and
that I had somehow missed it because of my lost week as a zombie. “I want
to keep this between the four of us, okay, Bret?” Susan said. She had eaten
the slice down to its crust and placed it on a napkin by her plate. Debbie was
helping herself to another serving of the salad. Thom swigged from his
Corona again and reached for the pizza, which was now a half-circle.
“Why?” I suddenly asked. “What’s wrong?”
Susan was addressing me, not Thom or Debbie, because, of course, they
already knew. “Dr. Croft, um, wanted me to relay that everyone should be
friendly to Robert and to encourage us to include him in things and just make
him feel that he belongs here. At Buckley. With us.”
“Why would Dr. Croft ask you this?” I stared at Susan while I gulped
down half a glass of the champagne I’d just poured, controlling the hand
holding the bottle so it wouldn’t shake.
“Well, it seems that Robert wasn’t exactly up front when we first met
him…” Susan started. “He wasn’t at Roycemore last spring.”
I just stared at Susan while Thom and Debbie casually ate.
“Where was he?” I asked.
“He was in Illinois,” Susan confirmed. “But he just wasn’t in school. He
was actually in Jacksonville.”
The silence in the kitchen from Thom and Debbie was almost maddening
and I suddenly looked over at both of them with an alarmed expression.
“Doing what?” I asked.
“He spent last spring being treated at a…developmental center,” Susan
said vaguely.
“A developmental center?” I asked, making a face. “What’s that?”
“Yeah, a developmental center, that’s what Dr. Croft called it,” Susan
said. “Being treated for…depression and…other issues Robert was having.”
I realized something. “You mean he was institutionalized,” I said. “You
mean he was put in a mental institution.” I looked to Thom and Debbie and
then back at Susan. “That’s what you mean.” I stayed calm but I felt sick,
heavy. I was on the verge of getting drunk but in that moment I pulled back,
because I needed to steady myself and maintain control.
“Dr. Croft called it a developmental center,” Susan corrected me, as if
subtly admonishing a child, reprimanding them so they wouldn’t make the
same mistake again. “He was discharged in May,” she added.
“Why don’t we just call it what it really is,” I said in a condescending
way. “An asylum.” I looked around the table. “Right? I mean ‘developmental
center’ is just a fancy term for ‘mental institution’ and ‘mental institution’ is
just a fancy term for ‘asylum.’ So Robert Mallory was in an insane asylum
last year. That’s what you’re telling me, Susan. And you want to throw a
party for him?”
“ ‘Asylum’ is a little dramatic, Bret,” Susan said and then sighed. “But
we’re used to you embellishing things, so—”
“You can call it whatever you want,” I said, holding my hands up.
“Developmental center is fine. I just want us to all know what we’re dealing
with here.”
“What we’re dealing with? He had some psychological issues,” Susan
said. “And took care of them. I don’t understand what’s wrong. What’s your
problem?”
“I think you’ve had too much to drink, babe,” Debbie said to me.
“Maybe cool it a little bit.”
“What were his psychological issues?” I asked, ignoring her.
“Well, I don’t really know. I assume his parents’ divorce, his mother’s
death, Dr. Croft mentioned there were drugs. Nothing hard-core.” Susan
immediately clarified, “Marijuana, and Croft said hallucinogens.” She was
looking at me for a reaction. “But he’s clean now.”
“Or so he says,” I said.
“What does that mean?” Thom asked in an attempt to defend Susan.
“He’s a liar,” I said. “Obviously he lied to us. He’s lied to me.”
“About what?” Debbie asked, turning, suddenly paying closer attention
to the conversation now that I had placed myself in the narrative.
“I saw him somewhere, here, in L.A., a year ago, at a movie theater,” I
said. “It was absolutely him. And he denied it. He’s a liar. And he lied about
Roycemore. And if he lied about Roycemore then he lied about the girlfriend
—”
“I don’t even know if he was a full-time patient—” Susan said.
“He had a girlfriend in the mental institution?” I asked. “If he was
discharged in May, Susan, that means he was a full-time patient.”
“It was the first time we met him,” Susan said. “He was probably
nervous. He was probably embarrassed. What? He’s going to announce this
automatically? I think we’d all couch the truth.” She stopped and then
pointedly said, “It’s not like you haven’t made up stuff before.”
“Oh, come on, Susan,” I said, raising my voice, frustrated. “It’s not the
same. I might embellish something but I don’t fucking lie. I might give things
a spin but I don’t make up a girlfriend I didn’t have or lie that I wasn’t in a
fucking insane asylum—”
“Oh, stop it,” Susan said. “You’re doing it now. Insane asylum? Give me
a break.”
“Have you talked to him about any of this?” I asked. “So you could,
y’know, clarify what he was in there for exactly?”
“No, I’m not going to ask him,” Susan said. “Croft told me not to
mention it to him. And I’m not. There’s no point. If Robert wants to bring it
up and tell us, fine. But he doesn’t know we know.” She looked at me sternly.
“And I want to keep it that way.”
“So you don’t know how severe his problem was—”
“Bret, it’s just a party,” Susan said, pleading.
“No, it’s a validation,” I said. “Actually, Susan, it’s a validation.”
“I think it’ll be the cool thing to do,” Thom said, stepping in again.
“But we don’t know him at all,” I stressed hard.
Susan and Debbie started at the same time defending Robert, overlapping
each other. “What are you talking about? What’s your problem, Bret? What’s
wrong with you?”
“How did he move on to his senior year if he was in this developmental
center and wasn’t discharged until May?” I interrupted. “How did he get into
Buckley?”
“Croft told me that he had a tutor there,” Susan said. “And after he was
discharged in May he went to summer classes and yes at Roycemore. And he
worked hard. He caught up. He’s smart. I don’t know.” Susan stopped. “It’s
not that hard to get into Buckley, Bret. And he’s smart. What?”
“I think a rather sizable donation was probably made, Susan,” I said.
“Let’s not be more naïve than we already are.” I let out an exaggerated sigh.
“Yeah, you can easily get into Buckley after spending six months in a mental
institution. Right.”
“What is wrong with you?” Susan asked, staring at me. “I don’t get it.”
And then the table was silent again. I had turned the night around from
where it was supposed to be heading—with friends ordering pizza from Santo
Pietro’s and having fun planning a party, the music, the food, who else to
invite outside of the Buckley circle—into what everyone now assumed was
my own paranoid cave, creating a scenario that didn’t connect with the facts
they thought they knew. I realized I had to defend myself, so I brought up
what happened Tuesday afternoon on Ventura Boulevard.
“First, the guy lied about something to me that I know is real, and then
he followed me like a maniac, fucking with me on Ventura Boulevard, and
then he’s stalking girls at the Galleria—”
“He said you were following him,” Susan said quietly, interrupting me.
“What?” I asked.
“He said you were following him,” Susan said again but this time with an
emphasis on those two words.
My gaze moved from Susan’s face and started scanning the room we
were in: my parents’ house had an open layout and the entrance past the foyer
led into an uninterrupted space, there were no walls, and off to the left was a
huge living room, minimally decorated with floor-to-ceiling windows that
constituted the entire side of the house overlooking the San Fernando Valley,
and this space flowed into the kitchen, where we were sitting, and I could
hear the music coming from the stereo in the living room—it was the Motels’
second album—and as I glanced at the half-circle of pizza I realized that
Robert Mallory had spoken to Susan and obviously to Thom as well, which
meant that Debbie knew this, too, about something I had supposedly done.
Robert had already told them something I wasn’t going to tell anybody. They
looked at me blankly, wanting me to confirm this or explain what really
happened, what my version of events was compared to Robert’s. The
information they had been given refuted my memory of that afternoon. But
still, the worst thing was that Susan Reynolds and Robert Mallory had talked
about me.
“What?” I asked again. “That’s not…true,” I said.
“He said you were following him first.” This was Thom’s voice.
“Yeah,” Susan said. “That you followed him from Buckley.”
“I was going to the Galleria,” I said. “I didn’t even know he was in the
Porsche.” I fumbled around. “It was so aggressive on his part. It was so
weird.” And then I asked, “Did he say he ran into me in the Galleria? That he
followed me into the Galleria? And that he was stalking girls there?”
“He said that he went to Robinson’s to buy some clothes,” Susan said.
“Yeah, I-I-I know, he-he told me that, too,” I stammered. “But I saw him
—”
“Look, are you with us?” Susan said, reaching a hand across the table.
“It’s just a party. It’s not a validation of anything. It’s just a party, Bret.”
“He’s drunk,” Debbie said.
“I’m not drunk,” I said. “In fact I’m extremely sober.”
“Right.” Debbie snickered and leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.
I was stunned and yet I pretended not to be and I visibly relaxed as I took
Susan’s hand in mine and squeezed it. “Yeah, of course, whatever you want.”
Thom grabbed my shoulder. “There he is,” he boomed. “He’s back! Bret
is back!”
I turned and smiled at his handsome face, which was beaming and made
me feel, foolishly, as if I had accomplished something by making Thom
Wright happy. Everyone was suddenly relieved. You could feel the tension
exit the space because I’d conceded or pretended to. I realized the only option
was to get obliterated. “Anyone want to do shots?” I quickly asked, standing
up, clapping my hands together. I had to push the slight panic I felt about
Susan’s party and Robert Mallory and the conversation the two of them had
about me out of my mind and discard it somewhere as far away as I possibly
could or I was going to hurt somebody.
—
MY PARENTS ONLY DRANK tequila in margaritas, so we didn’t have any
top-shelf brands in the house (nobody really did in 1981), but there was a
bottle of Jose Cuervo on the liquor shelf in the wet bar off to the side of the
living room. The girls wanted rum-and-Cokes—actually Debbie made herself
a rum-and-Tab—and so I brought out a bottle of Bacardi hidden behind two
Smirnoff bottles and filled up an ice bucket. Thom and I did shots and I
sliced a lime and sprinkled salt from a shaker on the side of my wrist and
licked it off. Thom usually didn’t drink alcohol but it was a Saturday and he
didn’t have to get up tomorrow and Susan would only be having one drink
and she’d be the designated driver even though Thom said he’d be fine
driving if he only had just a shot or two but instead we got drunk fast and I
was bringing out my records and soon Thom and I were blasting the Dickies
(Chuck Wagon, who played keyboards and saxophone, had shot and killed
himself in June; I had a crush on the bassist, Billy Club) in the living room
while the girls watched as we air-guitared and moshed to “Stuck in a Pagoda
with Tricia Toyota” and I remember at some point Debbie offered a couple
bumps of cocaine so I could semi-clear my head and then Susan did a small
line and so did Thom and the girls kept going outside to smoke while Thom
and I played songs we wanted to hear, slightly wired by the small amount of
cocaine we’d done, jamming out to tunes and lip-synching while I kept going
back to the bar to do shots until the Cuervo bottle was nearly empty.
We started hopping around to the drumbeat of David Lindley’s version
of “Mercury Blues” and then it was “Somebody Got Murdered” by the Clash,
where we took turns singing the verses (I was Mick Jones and Thom was Joe
Strummer) and as the song was ending I sung bug-eyed, “Sounds like
murder!” and then Thom shouted out, leaning in to me, “Those screams!” and
then we’d both sing “Are they drunk?” Beat. “Down below?,” which then led
to an actual duet: “From a Whisper to a Scream” where I sang along to the
Glenn Tilbrook vocal and Thom did Elvis Costello, both of us joining in on
the chorus, and then it was “Turning Japanese” by the Vapors and “What I
Like About You” by the Romantics and “Pretty in Pink” by the Furs and after
that it was “Skateaway” by Dire Straits and after about twenty songs I
staggered down the hallway to my bedroom so I could pass out. I was too
wasted to have sex with Debbie, who draped herself on top of me, kissing my
face and purring as the room spun and I was groaning and she thought it was
from drunkenness but it wasn’t, because no matter how wasted I got I
couldn’t erase the fact that someone was watching the house on Mulholland
—had been watching me, in fact, all summer long—and that I had been
targeted and the person who targeted me was the new boy from Chicago
racing after my car on Ventura Boulevard, who spoke intimately with Matt
Kellner and Susan Reynolds and was probably—and I didn’t have a doubt
about this even though I had no proof—the person holding the flashlight in
the library courtyard who desecrated the statue of the Buckley Griffin on the
night before school began.
—
I WAS NAKED ON MY stomach under a sheet and someone was gently
rubbing my back, purring into my ear, Debbie’s plush lips grazing the lobe,
the familiar smell of rose oil acting like a smelling salt, an ammonia, helping
me regain consciousness. I didn’t remember taking off my clothes before I
fell into bed last night and I was so hungover that it took me a long moment
to figure out where I actually was. I squinted at an unfamiliar wall I was
facing and then saw the Elvis Costello poster hanging on it and realized I was
in my bedroom. I slowly turned my neck and looked up at Debbie, who
laughed softly, sitting next to me, as she tallied the damage based on my
swollen face, my half-shut puffy eyes, the pained expression caused by the
headache and dehydration.
“Poor baby,” she said, leaning down and kissing me lightly on the lips,
and when I exhaled she backed off, waving her hand. “You still smell like
tequila. You okay?”
I couldn’t say anything—I was paralyzed by the hangover. I never drank
the way I had last night and I could only blame myself: not Robert Mallory or
Susan, who was throwing a party for him, or Thom Wright, who I’d so badly
desired last night while the girls were outside, or how I wanted to drown the
actor I’d become who salvaged his relationship with Debbie Schaffer with
one quick fuck yesterday afternoon. The clock on the nightstand said,
inexplicably, it was one-thirty. I squinted back at Debbie, who looked
completely radiant—she had washed and blow-dried her hair in my bathroom
and put on light makeup and was dressed and she seemed so much more
relaxed than yesterday afternoon, when she arrived at the house on
Mulholland—she was drained of the rigid insecurity and the black frustration.
She was calmed by the knowledge that I’d assured her about us and I was
momentarily relieved.
I was unable to fully open my eyes and my mouth and throat were so dry
I could only croak: “Where are you going?”
She was heading to Malibu to ride Spirit and she preferred Sundays in
the late afternoon since she wouldn’t be going out that night to see a band or
check out a club. It was still so incongruous: Debbie in a bikini teasing John
Taylor by the pool at the Hilton while we were hanging out with Duran
Duran last summer also owned a horse named Spirit and had for a number of
years competed in equestrian sports—the disconnect always suggested a
lingering innocence to me. She’d been riding since seventh grade and even
though other interests had started occupying her—mainly music and concerts
and bands and she had stopped competing—she could never shake off the
pleasure she got from horseback riding—it was comforting, it touched me.
I was burrowing my head back into the pillow when she said, “Matt
Kellner called.”
I knew Debbie was wrong. I knew this was an impossibility. The odds of
this happening were nonexistent. In the fourteen months since we started
having sex Matt Kellner had never called the house on Mulholland, not even
once. It had simply never happened and it was unfathomable that he knew my
phone number and picked up the receiver and dialed it that morning. But I
became worried almost immediately, when Debbie repeated this, as I
processed that Debbie wasn’t lying.
“You’re friends with Matt Kellner?” Debbie asked. “I didn’t know that.”
“Kind of,” I said. “Not really.” I paused. “Did you talk to him?”
“He seems a little strange,” Debbie said. “Yeah, I picked up.”
“Oh, yeah?” I said, trying to act casual. I sat up and winced. “Did he say
what he wanted?” It seemed unreal that I was even asking that. “Are you sure
it was Matt Kellner? You’re not getting him mixed up with someone else?”
“Yes, it was Matt,” Debbie said. “I just find it weird that you guys are
friends and I never knew.”
“I wouldn’t say we’re friends exactly…” I started, and then realized that
sentence could open two or three doors for Debbie and I wanted to keep them
all shut. “I know him,” I said vaguely. And then I decided on: “Sometimes I
buy weed from him.”
“That’s what I thought,” she said. “Anyway he just wanted to know if
you were here but I said you were asleep.”
“Did he tell you I should call him back?” I asked tentatively.
“No. Nothing. Didn’t leave a message.” Debbie looked at her watch and
then at me—she was relaxed and smiling. “I’ll talk to you tonight,
handsome.” And then she left.
The moment I heard the front door open, then close, I hobbled into the
bathroom and peed with a hard-on, splashing urine all over the rim of the
toilet seat. Wincing, I walked quickly, gingerly, to the pool, where I simply
fell into the deep end and sank to the bottom and stayed there until I couldn’t
hold my breath any longer and pushed to the surface, feeling less pain and the
horniness mildly abated. When I was slightly clearheaded, I hauled my body
out of the cool water, but I stumbled where the concrete surrounding the pool
met the grass, stubbing my toe, which seemed more painful than it actually
was because of how sensitive I felt due to the hangover—everything, in fact,
seemed heightened, dramatic, over-scaled. In my bedroom I dried off quickly
and immediately threw on a pair of tennis shorts, a Polo shirt and my
Topsiders and hurried to the garage, where I pulled the 450SL out of the
driveway and made a left onto Mulholland and then another left onto
Woodcliff and raced down the canyon to Valley Vista then to Haskell
Avenue—it took maybe ten minutes.
—
I PARKED on the street, jumped out of the car, unlatched the side gate, and
walked the pathway to the backyard directly to the pool and the guesthouse
beyond it. The door was open and when I walked in I didn’t see Matt. I
looked around an empty room—it seemed barren but that could have been
because it was finally clean. My first thought: furniture was missing, and yet
maybe the room was simply rearranged by Matt. The aquarium was now fully
drained, the TV was on but the volume was turned down and fires raged
silently somewhere in the distant hillsides, the room still smelled of weed but
not as strongly as usual and there was no sign of Alex the cat. And then I
looked at the Foreigner 4 poster above the hamper, which was neatly tamped
down with clothes, and walked toward it: the record had been released in July
and the poster was a simple black and white image of the number 4—frozen
on the countdown of an old-fashioned film leader. The poster was completely
minimal with the logo of the band’s name at the top in blood-red lettering. It
was a large and mostly off-white-and-gray image except for the bold black
number 4, which took up the center. As I moved closer I noticed that
someone had drawn what looked like a star off to the left corner of the poster
and it was large enough for me to know that the star hadn’t been there on
Monday: it was a new decoration. But when I peered at it I realized it wasn’t
a star: someone had drawn a pentagram. I remember Matt had told me he
found the poster rolled up and sticking out of the mailbox—something
promotional, and he didn’t know who had left it. I then looked over at the
dolphin mounted on the wall, shellacked and dead-eyed—in my hungover
daze I imagined it was staring at the boy standing in the middle of the
guesthouse.
“I’m here,” someone said behind me.
—
I WHIRLED AROUND. Matt was reclining on the bed, propped against the
wall, in the tight lime-green bathing suit he favored and a faded Dodgers Tshirt and wearing sunglasses. I hadn’t seen him when I walked in because the
bed had been moved to the side of the room next to the entrance and I’d
passed unaware that a person was on it. I just stared at Matt, not knowing
what to say. He looked pale as he sat there unmoving, diminished somehow,
less sexy than he’d been only a week earlier, but I suddenly desired him with
a ferocity that was impossible to manage—the hangover made me
desperately horny. I couldn’t help it—I became excited and started getting a
hard-on since I solely associated the room with Matt and sex. The hangover
was aiding in the arousal but so were Matt’s bare thighs, his biceps, the fulllipped mouth. For a moment I wished it away and focused on the pipe and the
bag of weed sitting next to him on the bed. What had he wanted when he
called that morning? I kept wondering, on the verge of panic. But he spoke
first.
“Why do you keep calling me?” Matt asked flatly.
A mixture of confusion and surprise altered my focus. “What are you
talking about?”
When he slowly repeated this, spacing out the words for emphasis
—“Why. Do. You. Keep. Calling. Me?”—I realized he was pissed off. I had
never heard this tone from Matt before.
“I’m…not calling you,” I said.
Matt took off his sunglasses and his green eyes were hard and blank as
he assessed me. “You’re not calling and just breathing into the phone?” he
asked.
“No, I’m not doing that,” I said, confused. “Why…would I call? You
never pick up anyway. Why are you picking up the phone now? Who’s…
calling you?”
“You’ve been rather insistent, Bret,” Matt said, resembling a bad actor in
a mystery where he thinks he’s found out who the murderer is—the “rather”
sounded completely unlike him, as if he thought it was a word that would
make him seem smart. I realized he’d probably been practicing exactly what
he was going to say to me all morning and rehearsed his lines in such a
precise way that I would have to admit what I was being accused of even
though he had no proof and was wrong.
“That isn’t me,” I said. “Whatever the fuck is going on that isn’t me.”
“Well, you’re here now.” He gestured at the green rotary phone on his
desk. “And it isn’t ringing.”
“I got wasted last night and I was asleep until an hour ago.”
Matt just stared at me in a way that confirmed he was unconvinced.
“I was with Debbie. She spent the night. She can vouch for me. I didn’t
call anybody.” I initially liked the way I could offer this information to Matt
and he knew it was true because he spoke briefly to Debbie that morning. I
also realized that Debbie would never make Matt Kellner jealous or draw him
closer after I wondered what he thought about Debbie and me as a couple. I
was someone who had so eagerly sucked him off a hundred times and
endlessly played with his asshole, fingering and fucking and tonguing it, and
kissed his mouth while talking dirty, and yet I was now with Deborah
Schaffer. I realized in that moment he must have thought I was a fraud, an
impostor—that how I reacted to him was passionately real and whatever I
was doing with Debbie was tied to pretending because I wasn’t as sexually
attracted to her as I was to him. It was connected to what Matt saw as the fake
social world of Buckley that I thought I’d wanted to be at the center of our
senior year, which was why I ended up with Debbie Schaffer. I’m certain he
had nothing but disdain for this person I turned out to be instead of the loner
lost in summer school he perhaps thought I was when he invited me to
Haskell Avenue in July of 1980. “Whoever’s calling you isn’t me,” was all I
said. And I couldn’t believe amiable-stoner nice-guy Matt was convinced that
it was.
“It has been going on all week, Bret,” Matt said, barely keeping it
together. “The phone calls. You haven’t called six times this morning, just
letting the phone ring and ring until I have to pick it up and you just don’t say
anything?” He couldn’t help it: he had reverted to the boy he really was,
confused, scared, and completely untethered to the reality of the world. And
then, even more sadly, I realized that of course he thought it was me: I was
the only friend he had, and was I even a friend? The confusion I felt mixed
with the stress of Matt being angry at me and my horniness and the hangover
became overwhelming and I remember that I needed to lean against
something or sit down but I didn’t because I was positive Matt didn’t want
me to.
“And you haven’t been coming over here?” he asked. “Going through
my things?”
“Matt,” I said, my eyes closed. “Please, stop it. What are you talking
about?”
“Well, I didn’t do this,” Matt said, and raised his hand to gesture around
the room.
“Do what?”
“Put the furniture like this.”
I paused, thought it through, didn’t exactly believe him at first.
“Did the housekeeper or maybe your mom—” I started.
“My mom?” he cut me off with an incredulity that suggested I existed on
another planet. “You didn’t come over here and move my bed one afternoon
this week—”
“Matt—”
“—and push all that shit to the other side of the room?”
“Matt, I’m sorry,” I said, and then I couldn’t help it. Suddenly I blurted
out: “What did you and Robert Mallory talk about the other day?” In that
moment I needed to know this. It was more important than anything that had
happened in the pool house: the rearranged furniture, the empty aquarium, the
pentagram on the Foreigner poster, the phone ringing endlessly.
“Yeah, that’s another thing,” Matt said, staring at me. “What did you tell
him?”
I was losing my patience and I shouted out, “What did he want? What
did he say to you?”
“He introduced himself to me,” Matt said, glaring. “He heard that my
dad knew his aunt.”
“And that was it?” I asked.
Matt’s face clouded over with suspicion. “What did you tell him about
us?”
“I didn’t tell him anything,” I said with an urgency that surprised me.
“You’re stoned, and drugged out, you’re smoking too much fucking weed,
you’re disoriented. You don’t know anything. This is crazy.”
“Does Robert Mallory know something happened between us?” Matt
asked with a steady calmness that belied his anxiety.
Dizziness swept over me again. I needed to sit down. “What are you
talking about? What did he say? I didn’t talk to him about us.”
“He didn’t say anything exactly,” Matt said in a steely voice. “But he
hinted at it.”
“Is that what you were talking about in the parking lot?” I asked. “What
was he telling you that day in the parking lot?”
“Yeah,” Matt said. “He asked a couple of questions about you.”
I panicked. I felt fear. “Like what?”
Matt didn’t say anything until: “I didn’t know the answers to the
questions.”
“Are you sure you’re not making this all up, Matt?” I asked, and then
began to completely ramble. “Because I think you’re making this all up. I
think you got fucking stoned and did something to the aquarium and that you
rearranged the room and drew the fucking pentagram on the poster because
you were fucking high as fuck and that’s what I think.” Matt just stared at me
with his incredulous stare, unwavering. “Look, I’d stay away from Robert,” I
said, and I didn’t care if Matt told him I said this. In fact I wanted him to. “I
think there’s something really wrong with him and I don’t think he’s…all
there. I think there’s something very wrong with him.” I stopped, even
though I was tempted to tell Matt about the mental institution in Jacksonville
I’d promised Susan I wouldn’t tell anyone else about and in that moment it
really didn’t seem that pertinent. “What was he telling you that day in the
parking lot? What was he asking about me?”
Matt was now just looking at my face dully. “Stop calling.” And then:
“Don’t come over here anymore.”
I didn’t realize I’d moved closer to the bed; my hard-on was so stiff it
was painful—the hangover had electrified me with lust.
“Matt,” I said reaching out to him.
The expression on his face when he realized I wanted to have sex was
the worst moment I ever shared with Matt Kellner. He looked at the hard-on
jutting up and making a tent in my tennis shorts and then back at my face as
if he were appalled. I’d never seen this expression before. It was almost a
parody of fear and overexaggerated disgust.
“This was never a serious thing,” Matt said, looking at me, stunned.
“What are you doing?”
“Matt—” I was about to sit on the bed next to him.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Matt asked, backing away. “What do
you want to be? Boyfriends? You think we’re gonna be boyfriends? Are you
fucking crazy? Get away from me.”
I was so close now that he was able to physically push me back. Matt
stared at me with disbelief, furious. This was the Matt I never knew existed—
real and emotional, conflicted, angry and alive—and who I’d wanted to know
since I met him, and who finally revealed himself to me on that Sunday
afternoon in the minute it all ended. And it was heartbreaking that I would
never be coming back again and this fact wounded me to such a degree that
when I stumbled out of the pool house I could barely control myself until I
got to my car on Haskell Avenue and once I closed the door burst into tears,
falling against the steering wheel, hyperventilating, and it was a release so
intense that it was almost orgasmic. I drove home carefully because I kept
crying so hard: Matt had never felt about me the way I’d felt about him,
which would be a recurring theme for the rest of my life though, of course, I
didn’t know this yet on that September afternoon in 1981, when I was
seventeen and still navigated on hope.

BUT STEVEN REINHARDT called Monday morning as I was getting ready
to leave for Buckley and because of this everything about Matt Kellner and
my subsequent pain and desire began vanishing. The gray slacks were zipped
up and the white Armani shirt buttoned and the blue blazer had been freshly
ironed and I had just finished knotting the red-striped tie when the phone in
my bedroom rang. Rosa was in the kitchen making my lunch and I had piled
the textbooks I was taking to school next to the Olivetti, reluctant to pick up
the phone because I couldn’t figure out who’d be calling at eight-thirty on a
school day. Steven Reinhardt started leaving a message but I grabbed the
receiver in time and said, “Hey, Steve, it’s Bret. I’m here.”
“Oh, hey,” Steven said. “I’m calling because Terry wanted to know if
you were available for lunch this week.”
I was surprised, and then bolted with excitement: I hadn’t spoken to
Terry since Tuesday, when he thanked me for dealing with a drunken Liz the
night of Debbie’s barbecue—I’d been mild with her, I hadn’t made a scene, I
didn’t freak out—as she stood naked beneath her opened robe and berated
me, suggesting I was doing something sexual with her faggot husband. Terry
wanted to reward me for this even though I’d encountered Liz drunk a few
times and that night’s outburst was mild by comparison. Only Steven had
witnessed me and relayed my gentle reaction, which led Terry—gave him a
reason—to perhaps offer me a job writing a script while also telling me,
pointedly, not to mention this to his daughter, my girlfriend, for reasons I
wasn’t quite grasping, though in the back of my mind I probably knew
exactly why. Steven asked if I was free for lunch on either Wednesday or
Thursday. I thought Terry would have chosen a Saturday since I had school
and I remember asking, “Um, can’t he do it on the weekend?”
“No, sorry, Bret,” Steven said. “It has to be during the week. Terry’s
schedule this weekend is pretty packed.”
“Oh, okay,” I said. “Let me see.” I pretended I was perusing my own
packed schedule but of course there was nothing on it and so I simply said, as
if I was deciding decisively: “Okay, I can swing either Wednesday or
Thursday.”
“Let’s mark down Wednesday,” Steven said. “Trumps at one?”
“One o’clock,” I said. “Trumps.”
“Do you know where that is?”
“Yeah, I know where that is.”
“Okay, the reservation is under ‘Schaffer’ at one on Wednesday at
Trumps,” Steven confirmed.
“Thanks, Steven,” I said. “I’ll be there.”
“Yeah, one more thing,” Steven said. “You’ll be coming straight from
school, right?”
“Yeah. Why?”
“You don’t need to change out of your uniform,” Steven said matter-offactly. “You can just stay in your uniform.”
“Oh,” I said, thinking at first this would make everything easier since I
wouldn’t have to take the time to go home and change, but then realized there
was something performative about this request and, of course, Terry wanted
me in my Buckley uniform because it accentuated something for him—my
youth, my boyishness—and suggested a narrative he might take advantage of
even though I wasn’t going to do anything with him. This was simply, I
thought, a fetish, something that would amuse Terry and turn him on. The
uniforms were stylish enough so I had no problem wearing one in public and
yet I blushed deeply at the unapologetic weirdness of the request as I stood in
my bedroom. “And, of course,” Steven added, “Terry asked me to remind
you not to say anything to Debbie about meeting him for lunch.”
“Yeah, right, of course,” I assured him, wanting to please both Terry as
well as Steven in that moment. It was our secret and there were reasons why
Debbie didn’t need to know that I was having lunch with her father. I might
not have been privy to them exactly but I believed that Terry, and to a lesser
extent Steven Reinhardt, knew how to handle things, because Terry was an
adult, he was a man, he was successful—he must know exactly what he was
doing. I was only seventeen, I didn’t have a teenage daughter, my wife
wasn’t an alcoholic, I was just finding out how the adult world worked, what
its rules were, how to comport myself within it, I needed guidance and I was
beginning to select the adults I’d take my cues from and Terry Schaffer was
one of them.
—
AND ON THAT WEDNESDAY in September I left the Buckley campus at
twelve-thirty without telling anybody.
The group was sitting together at the center table beneath the shadow of
the Pavilion: Susan, Thom, Debbie, Ryan, along with Jeff Taylor and Tracy
Goldman, and Robert Mallory. I stood in the distance, below the courtyard,
obscured by a stucco column, and glimpsed Debbie looking around for me,
distracted, with Ryan and Thom and Jeff all trying to talk over each other,
vying for everyone’s attention, while Robert Mallory and Susan Reynolds
listened silently on opposite ends of the table with Tracy occasionally leaning
in to Robert and laughing about something—he just smiled politely. I didn’t
see Matt Kellner in the plaza, where he was usually splayed during lunch,
though I’d seen him earlier that day walking from the parking lot to the bell
tower when I was sitting on the bench with Susan and Thom—we were
hanging out waiting for Debbie before first period began—and Matt passed
by and managed a nod, and we silently acknowledged each other throughout
the week. Despite what happened we didn’t pretend the other one wasn’t
there—we were slightly more mature than that, and the school was too small
to encourage that kind of brush-off. And this helped me move on and erase
the humiliation of Sunday afternoon even though I kept thinking: Move on
from what? I wasn’t as embarrassed as I might have been about Matt’s
rejection now that it was Wednesday because I was on my way to meet Terry
Schaffer, and it also helped that Matt Kellner simply didn’t look as vibrant
and sexy, the nerdy hot surfer, as he had that past summer—something
seemed to be draining him. He looked diminished.
—
TRUMPS SAT ON THE CORNER of Robertson Boulevard and Melrose
Avenue, across the street from Morton’s, which was the primary restaurant
frequented by people in the film industry—Trumps was less formal, less
business-attire, more relaxed and decidedly gayer, and, pulling into the
driveway where the valet stood, I realized I was early—it had only taken
fifteen minutes to arrive in West Hollywood from Sherman Oaks—and I
thought about driving around the block until the allotted time I was supposed
to meet Terry. But I decided to leave the car with the valet and have a drink at
the bar while waiting—something to relax me, a cocktail to help mellow out.
The majority of the cars at Trumps were parked in back of the restaurant but
there seemed to be a kind of selective VIP section next to the valet where the
Ferraris and Bentleys and Porsches were lined that day. I pulled one of the
massive double front doors open next to where the name of the restaurant was
written in small pink handwritten neon, a playful touch hinting that Trumps
didn’t take itself so seriously; Trumps was about L.A. and artifice and a new
kind of freewheeling California Cuisine—it was supposed to be fun. I’d been
to Trumps twice but only at night, once with my mother for dinner, and with
Thom and Susan for drinks, when the space was dimmed with candles.
During the day it was a shock: a high-ceilinged oversized room filled with
light and lined with wheat-colored stone tables beneath an atrium—a huge
white space that sat roughly a hundred people, and it was dramatic and
modern, yet also whimsical and unpretentious.
Nearing one o’clock it was already packed and when I told the hostess
who I was meeting she was very apologetic: Terry hadn’t arrived yet and I
was welcome to either sit at his table or wait at the bar. I was going to be way
too self-conscious sitting alone at Terry’s table—it was Table One—so I told
the hostess I’d wait at the bar for Mr. Schaffer instead. The hostess walked
me over and leaned toward the cute blond bartender and pointedly said, “This
is Terry’s guest,” as if to let him know I was important, part of the scene, a
young player.
—
A SERIES OF ED RUSCHA PRINTS lined the white wall above the bar and
continued across the lounge and into the front of the dining room, adjacent to
where I took a seat and scanned the restaurant, shocked to see Jerry Brown,
the governor of California, sitting at a corner table near the back with two
men and a woman whose face was blocked by another diner—I hoped it was
Linda Ronstadt, who Brown had been dating and whose New Wave record
Mad Love I played over and over last year, but I wasn’t sure if they were still
together. I saw Erik Estrada, the star of CHiPs, at one table, and Elizabeth
Montgomery—Samantha on Bewitched—at another, and Allan Carr, the
producer of Grease, in the banquette with two hot young guys, and even
though I was seventeen I knew who the painter David Hockney was and
immediately recognized him sitting at a table facing the bar, owlish and
smoking a cigarette, and staring at me, registering the schoolboy uniform in a
very thoughtful and intrigued way, and I turned back to the bartender, who
was acknowledging my presence with a patient smile. I ordered a Greyhound,
vodka and grapefruit juice, and the bartender asked to see my ID, which I
showed him, and he studied it a beat longer than I was comfortable with. He
looked away from the ID and then at what I was wearing: I left the Buckley
blazer with the insignia of the Griffin in the Mercedes, so I could’ve been any
dude wearing what looked like the semblance of a prep-school uniform: gray
slacks, white button-down, striped tie. “Cute,” he said, and then proceeded to
make the drink—I loved the fact that the Greyhound at Trumps was made
with freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice: it was festive, it was fun, it was
gay. And of course, I now realize, the bartender let me order whatever I
wanted because I was Terry Schaffer’s guest, regardless of how old I was.
After two large swallows of the cocktail I got up the nerve to glance
around the dining room again and saw that David Hockney’s companion,
who I didn’t recognize, was now turning around every so often to get a look
at the bar to glimpse the boy in the school uniform while Hockney grinned
mischievously. I understand, and it’s really only now, as a much older man,
seventeen in L.A. had a special power that I hadn’t fully grasped, the age
when I started noticing that men of a certain demo, like Terry Schaffer and a
few of the fey male teachers in the arts and music divisions at Buckley—the
flamers Jeff Taylor sometimes referred to—began engaging in flirtatious
ways that I thought I wasn’t quite worthy of. But looking at photos of myself
from that senior year I now realize I actually was cute enough to warrant their
attention, and this was the afternoon in 1981, at the bar in Trumps on a
Wednesday, sipping a Greyhound cocktail, when I began to fully sense its
formation, and when this consciousness about myself—that never really
bloomed because of so much insecurity and self-abnegation—was beginning
its struggle to accept itself and grow.
—
IT WAS NOW a little after one o’clock and Terry still hadn’t shown up but
the cocktail put me in a calmer space and I breathed in, breathed out, vaguely
floating, but Steven Reinhardt was suddenly standing next to me and even
more off-putting in the brightness of Trumps compared to a week ago at the
Schaffers’ house: here in the airy light he was too thin, the wispy blond
mustache and the permed hair adorned what resembled an emaciated face, a
skull with deep-set wide eyes, and he was wearing a ratty brown turtleneck
and jeans that barely clung to his bony frame and sandals but he had taken his
expensive sunglasses off, and was swinging them around as if he was the
hippest guy in the room. The fact that Steven thought he was a player because
he was Terry Schaffer’s personal assistant was a reminder of the constant
desperation flooding Hollywood and how the town made everyone
completely delusional.
“Hey Bret,” Steven said. “Terry’s across the street, over at Morton’s, just
finishing something up. He should be here shortly.”
“Oh, okay,” I said. “Thanks, Steven.”
Steven eyed me up and down, taking note of the uniform, and then the
near-empty cocktail on the napkin in front of me and said nothing—just
acknowledged it as a detail that would be reported back to Terry, and I
realized this was one of the reasons why Steven remained an assistant and
was never going to be a successful screenwriter or filmmaker. I was learning
about how the world worked from the ways adults acted and presented
themselves, what they noticed and thought was important, and what they
ignored or took in stride, and it confirmed to me that afternoon in Trumps,
and more clearly than ever before, that Steven Reinhardt was a loser. I
couldn’t explain exactly why—it was just a feeling I got from the way he
looked at the empty cocktail glass. “Thanks, Steven,” I said again, turning
away.
“Terry really appreciates this,” Steven said.
“There’s really nothing to appreciate,” I said, staring at the shelves of
liquor, the Ruscha prints. “I understand that Liz has a problem and she needs
help. That’s all. I was just being nice to her.”
“Yeah,” Steven said. “She’s got to recognize that there’s a problem but
y’know…” He trailed off.
I wasn’t sure what to say, so I idly glanced at my watch: a cue, a hint, for
Steven to leave.
“I would, um, be…” Steven started, and then stopped. He considered
finishing the sentence and then decided to. “I would just be, ah, careful,
Bret.”
“Pardon me?” I said, turning to him and leaning in. I didn’t think I’d
heard him correctly.
The bartender interrupted and asked Steven if he wanted anything to
drink and Steven shook his head no.
“I’d be careful about, y’know, Terry.” He said this shrugging, in an
almost apologetic way, and yet the seriousness of it broke through the buzz of
vodka and scared me.
“I will,” I said automatically, trying to placate him, while I thought: why
in the hell would I placate Steven Reinhardt? And I asked, “What’s that
supposed to mean?”
“It means…” Steven leaned against the bar, then pushed himself away,
gripping the stone counter, trying to stay casual, trying to aim for hip and
loose, and failing. “It means everyone has an agenda.”
“Yeah?” I said.
“Terry has one, I have one.” He paused. “You have one.”
“Really?” I asked. “What’s my agenda?” Steven just stared at me.
“What’s your agenda, Steven?” I played it cool but I was getting revved up
inside.
“I meant generally,” Steven said, weaseling out of defining whatever
he’d hinted at, and backing away from this threat he’d tossed out. “I didn’t
mean specifically.” He paused. “Sometimes these agendas don’t connect with
what we actually want or what we’re going to get. That’s all.” He paused
again. “Just be careful.”
I felt daring, in a place above him, and I was going to remind Steven that
he was only an assistant and that he was dismissed—I’d wait for Terry alone
at the bar and if I wanted another fucking Greyhound I’ll order it and down it
in one gulp, you stupid bastard. “Just don’t take it so seriously,” he said,
leaving it undefined, though I knew at some point Terry was going to hit on
me and test how far he could push things and I was going to have to make a
decision about what my boundaries were. But I went in knowing what could
happen: this wasn’t an ambush or an assault. I walked into the room realizing
a number of unwanted narratives could present themselves and I’d have to
deal. And then I realized Steven sounded as if he was talking about himself in
some abstract way and it reminded me of what Robert Mallory said while we
stood in front of the Gap at the Sherman Oaks Galleria last week: When you
talk to me you’re really talking to yourself, dude. It sounded like the ominous
hippie nonsense Charles Manson might have uttered and I shivered at the
memory of Robert telling me this.
“I can take care of myself,” I said. “Don’t worry.”
“I’m not worried about you so much,” Steven murmured, and then, “I
think I’ve got you figured out.” And then he said it: “I guess I’m more
worried about Deborah.” And now his eyes landed on mine and he just
stared. I stared back. Things were veering out of control and I had to steady
the narrative.
“You’ve got me figured out?” I asked. “That’s interesting. I barely have
myself figured out. What have you figured out?”
“Well, you’re here to have lunch with Terry,” he said. “I didn’t think you
were going to do it.” He paused. “For many reasons.” He paused again. “And
yet here you are.”
“Yeah, here I am,” I said, turning on the bar stool. “What do you really
want to tell me, Steven? What do you really want to say?”
Suddenly he glanced behind me and fake-smiled, raising his eyebrows.
Terry had just walked in.
“I think you need to watch it,” Steven said. “I think you need to be
careful.” He paused before he moved away from the bar and then said,
“Modulate yourself.”
“Fuck you,” I muttered under my breath, but I was safe because I knew
he couldn’t hear me.
—
I REMEMBER TERRY SCHAFFER WAS WEARING jeans and a collarless
Pierre Cardin shirt, the top three buttons undone, and the Porsche Carrera
sunglasses he favored. He held the hostess’s hand as he kissed her on the
cheek and then smiled as he saw Steven and myself moving toward him and I
noticed that every gesture of Terry’s was efficient and immaculate,
something to emulate and aspire toward—he was a professional, an adult,
someone I wanted to be. I was shown to Terry’s table while Terry and Steven
conferred by the hostess stand for a moment and I couldn’t bear to look
around the dining room—I was too embarrassed. I just concentrated on the
menu until I glanced up and saw Terry walking toward me—he stopped
twice, talking to two tables on the way to his. He noticed someone else across
the room and raised his hand as he took a seat—it was Jerry Brown, who
raised a hand back.
“Hey, how you doing, Bret,” Terry said, draping a linen napkin over his
lap. “You look nice. But you’re seventeen, you always look nice at
seventeen.”
He still had the Porsche Carrera sunglasses on and I was afraid he wasn’t
going to take them off, but when he glanced over the menu and then looked
at me, he removed them and slid the temple into the neck of the Pierre Cardin
shirt. I realize, in retrospect, how handsome Terry was for someone forty,
which was certainly not my type in that moment (it’s rarely my type now, I
regret to say), but he was also aiming for younger than forty—a short boyish
haircut, a lean build he maintained because of a personal trainer (before this
was a thing yet), the casual attire. He seemed very pleased and didn’t say
anything for a moment as he took me in with barely contained amusement—I
was being stared at and appraised. And then a waiter in a string tie and a
white apron brought Terry a bottle of Perrier and asked me what I’d like and I
said just a ginger ale, and that’s when Terry and the waiter exchanged a
bemused glance—and I was reminded, in that moment, yet again, that
Trumps had a gay vibe—I knew that the chef was gay, the big investors were
gay, the designer of the space was gay, all or most of the waiters were gay,
even the location was gay: smack in the middle of what was known as
Boystown. The entire aesthetic had an undercurrent of fuck you to the
straight status quo and I suddenly felt slightly uncomfortable being there at
the center of it. Terry ordered a couple of appetizers: the grape-and-Brie
quesadilla that the restaurant was famous for and the salmon tartar, which
was served exactly nowhere yet in Los Angeles.
—
THE TALK QUICKLY went to movies and Terry asked me what I’d seen
this year that I liked and I remember the conversation initially landed on the
filmmaker John Boorman, who had rebounded after a couple of expensive
flops with a moderate hit this past spring, Excalibur, a violent R-rated
retelling of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and Terry had
liked it too and asked if I’d seen Boorman’s L.A. noir from 1967, Point
Blank. I hadn’t even heard of it, though I’d now be searching for the movie
on the monthly calendars from the Nuart and New Beverly, the two revival
theaters I frequented—Terry assured me it was great, Boorman’s best film. I
was a John Waters fan and a group of us had gone to a sneak preview of his
latest movie, Polyester, in Westwood over the summer, starring Divine and
featuring a gimmick called Odorama, where you could smell what was on the
screen in certain sequences with a scratch-and-sniff card handed out in the
lobby (the movie’s ad line was “It’s Scentsational!”), but Terry hadn’t seen it.
I also liked Stripes, the Bill Murray army comedy that was a big hit that
summer, and Terry did as well. However, he balked when I told him I liked a
little-seen Barbra Streisand movie called All Night Long with Gene Hackman
and an impossibly sexy young actor named Dennis Quaid and Terry laughed
and made a dismissive gesture with his hand and said, “Sue’s husband made
that picture!” and then “It was terrible!” He was talking about Jean-Claude
Tramont, the Belgian husband of Sue Mengers, a fairly big talent agent who
represented Streisand. Terry thought the movie was awful and couldn’t stand
Barbra even though he “adored” Sue, and yet I wasn’t embarrassed by my
opinion because I liked how honest he was—how adult he treated me. It felt
like there was a new kind of grown-up respect burgeoning between Terry and
myself. Terry mentioned that he had just been to a screening of a movie he
thought was going to do “quite well” called Chariots of Fire, which would be
opening at the end of the month. I barely noticed that the appetizers had
arrived and neither one of us had touched them.
—
TERRY ORDERED AN ENTRÉE OFF THE MENU, an omelet with tomato
and avocado for himself, and suggested I have either the lobster in vanilla
sauce or the potato pancakes and goat cheese. “Neither are as crazy as they
sound,” Terry said, before giving the order to our waiter, choosing the lobster
for me instead of the pancakes. Allan Carr came over to the table as he was
leaving and shook Terry’s hand and said hello—he seemed high and looked
haggard. Terry didn’t introduce me as Debbie’s boyfriend when Allan Carr
inquired as to who this “handsome young gentleman” was, but instead said,
“This is Bret Ellis, he’s going to be writing a script for me. About…young
people.” “Ooh, young people,” Allan Carr said, “I love it.” An executive who
Terry didn’t introduce me to replaced Allan Carr and I took this as an
opportunity to excuse myself to the men’s room, where I focused on the boy
in the mirror and studied him. I was expecting to see someone older but in
Trumps the Buckley uniform looked dumb: I resembled an oversized child
pretending to be an adult, or an adult pretending to be an oversized child,
which was even worse. When I sat back down, deflated, Terry was in the
middle of eating the omelet that had quickly appeared and the lobster tail was
waiting for me. I draped the napkin over my lap.
“Debbie told me you want to be a writer,” he said. “I never knew this
about you.”
“Well, yeah,” I said. “I’ve been writing stories and stuff since like fifth
grade.”
“Really?” Terry said, forking a slice of avocado. “That’s very
impressive.”
“Yeah,” I said. “I, um, enjoy it.”
“So—what are you working on?” he asked while concentrating on his
plate.
“I’m working on a novel,” I said, suddenly thinking how absurd this all
sounded.
“A novel, really?” Terry asked, glancing at me, surprised, eyebrows
raised.
“Well, it’s something I’ve been working on for about a year and…” I
started, not sure I could fully explain the process. I changed course. “Actually
I began with an outline and that took a long time, but, um…” I trailed off. A
long pause ensued. Terry took another bite of the omelet.
“So you do an outline?” Terry asked, encouraging me to continue.
“Yeah, but I’m now writing the prose and, um, yeah…” I felt completely
inarticulate, broken, that I didn’t belong here, that I was a child aspiring to
become an adult but wasn’t ready yet. I looked at the pink flesh of the lobster
on my plate and realized even if I’d been hungry I wasn’t comfortable
enough to eat anything in front of Terry.
“What’s it about?” he asked.
I didn’t know exactly how to describe Less Than Zero. And I didn’t want
to: it was about me but there was no story, there were scenes but it didn’t
have a narrative exactly, there was just this drifting numb quality that I was
trying to perfect. How could I possibly explain this amorphous feeling to
someone? Terry waited, glanced up from the omelet, wondering why I
paused. I was trying to figure out how to synopsize whatever it was I’d been
typing dutifully every day at the Olivetti in my teenage-boy bedroom for the
past year, and came up with: “I guess it’s about me.”
“Yeah?” Terry asked. “So it’s autobiographical? A coming-of-age
story?”
“Well, it’s set here in L.A. and…” I remember what Terry said to Allan
Carr. “It’s about young people,” I confirmed.
“What do they do?” Terry asked, glancing up at me as he kept eating.
I didn’t know how to answer this because it didn’t matter to me what the
characters did. They existed, and I just wanted to convey a mood, immerse a
reader into a particular atmosphere that was built from carefully selected
details. What did the young people do? This suggested there was a plot, a
story that was going to resolve itself. They hung out, they listened to music,
they had sex, they went to clubs, sometimes they consumed drugs, they
attended parties in mansions where there were pools and tennis courts and
screening rooms, they drove aimlessly around the city at night, their parents
were absent, they went shopping along Rodeo, they moved through the world
alone, they stared at chandeliers high on acid. How could I sum this up in a
plot? It was, I imagined, about Jeff Taylor letting Ron Levin blow him—this
had, in the book, bloomed into the one tragic thread, what would become the
main incident that would close out the final chapters: a male prostitute owed
money to a drug dealer, or so I planned in my outline. The name was now
Julian, which I cribbed from Richard Gere’s character in American Gigolo.
“I’d rather not talk about it just yet, Terry,” I said, trying to mimic how
an adult would evade describing the particulars of what he’d just been asked.
“I feel a little awkward about it, I guess.”
“Don’t worry, no pressure,” he said. “I was just curious.” He finished the
omelet and slightly pushed his plate away and sat back in the chair,
appraising me again. I hadn’t touched my plate. Terry didn’t encourage me to
eat the lobster, or seem distracted at all when the waiter came and whisked
his plate away. Terry ordered a glass of white wine, and when the waiter
asked me if I wanted anything else I shook my head.
“The ice cream is pretty good,” Terry offered.
“I’m fine,” I said, blushing.
The waiter gestured at my plate and looked at Terry, who nodded, and
the waiter took it away.
“What writers do you like?” Terry asked.
“Well, I’ve been reading a lot of Joan Didion,” I said. “I’m really
influenced by her work.”
“Oh, I know Joan and John quite well,” Terry said. John was John
Gregory Dunne, Didion’s husband, and also a bestselling writer. “Maybe I’ll
invite them over and you can meet her.”
I really wasn’t that surprised at how casually Terry offered this—the
opportunity to meet Joan Didion, of all people, my favorite author, in Terry’s
world was completely possible. I knew this but “That would be awesome,” I
said, while trying to figure out what I was doing in Trumps at two o’clock on
a Wednesday afternoon with a forty-year-old man and bailing on school—it
was starting to seem surreal and this was confirmed when Jerry Brown
materialized and shook hands with Terry, who stood up and didn’t introduce
me—I blanked on what they talked about. After the governor walked away
Terry sat back down and studied me while I just glanced around the
restaurant, which was slowly emptying out. The waiter brought Terry the
glass of white wine. I suddenly wanted to leave.
“So,” he started, after taking a swallow of the Chardonnay. “How serious
are you about Debbie?” he asked. “I’m just curious. You started dating at the
beginning of the summer, right?”
“Um, yeah, in June, at a party, Anthony Matthews’s, um,” I confirmed
vaguely. “Yeah, we’re pretty serious, I guess.”
“As I said, I’m just curious,” Terry said. “There’s no need to look so
alarmed.”
I hadn’t realized that was my expression. “Oh, I’m okay,” I said.
Terry stared at me and took another swallow of wine, and then swirled it
around the glass. There was something in his tone that seemed to suggest
unasked questions: is there an alternate history, a secret one, what are you
really doing with my daughter, is this legit or is this suspect?
“It’s very serious, Terry,” I said.
“Come on, you can be honest with me,” Terry said. “I won’t tell
anyone.”
“I am being honest with you,” I said. “Why are you asking me this?”
“Well, I want her to be happy,” he said, taking another swallow of wine.
“I understand that,” I said. “I want her to be happy, too.”
“Good,” he said, and then suddenly asked, “Do you like guys as well?”
I sat very still, and started slowly shaking my head, reddening. “What?”
“I think you heard me,” Terry said. “Do you go both ways? I’m just
curious.”
This was something you asked an adult. I felt that with this one question
I was now effortlessly crossing to the other side of the room, where the
grown-ups were hanging out—but I wasn’t ready: I thought I’d been but I
wasn’t. I also realized I had to rise to the question and try to tell the truth.
“Well, I’m not limited,” was how I answered with what I thought was the
right touch of diplomacy. “I mean, it depends.” I tried to appear casual,
offered a little shrug, and then nervously sipped my ginger ale in the gayness
of Trumps.
“Depends on what?” Terry asked, still slightly smiling, staring at me.
“I guess it depends on…” And then I found myself admitting: “I
certainly wouldn’t kick Richard Gere out of bed, if that’s what you want to
know.” I was trying to sound tough and butch when I said that but I really
sounded evasive and lame.
“Yeah? What about Thom Wright?” Terry asked. “You find him hot?”
This was the beginning of the game Terry was proposing, the warm-up,
and if I wanted to get anywhere I had to at least try and play it. “Do you?” I
asked, staring back at him.
“Thom? Yeah, of course,” Terry said. “In fact I’m very jealous that you
get to spend so much time with him.” He thought about something. “He’s
pretty fetching, though I’m fairly sure his tastes are more…limited than
yours.”
“Sometimes I can’t tell if you’re joking around or not, Terry.”
“What do you mean?” Terry said. “I’m being totally serious.”
“I mean how do you know Thom’s tastes are more limited than mine?”
This came out the wrong way and suggested something I hadn’t intended.
“That’s interesting.” Terry sat up a little. “Come on, tell me, you ever
fool around with Thom, a little drunk, a little high, a sleepover, you guys get
horny and need to—”
“That’s not what I meant.” I tried to laugh but it sounded as if I had just
lightly coughed. “Thom is so not what you’re picturing.”
“Come on, what do you think of Thom?” Terry asked me. “What about
Jeff Taylor?”
“Terry, what do you think I think?” I asked.
He was enjoying himself, toying with me, making everything lightly
pervy. “I think that if your tastes, as you say, Bret, aren’t that limited then I
think you probably would want something to happen with Thom or Jeff.”
“Yeah, why them?” I asked.
“Because I think you’re all quite attractive young men,” he said. “You go
to school together. You share a locker room, I assume. You…shower
together. That’s all. They’re available.” He sipped his wine again.
“They’re not available,” I stressed.
“Okay, whatever you say,” Terry said, and then, “Richard Gere?
Really?”
Terry had just confirmed his homosexuality to me that afternoon—
something he had never admitted before in so many words; it was always just
innuendo, a dumb joke or suggestive phrasing, there had only been rumors.
What are you wearing? Terry asked me over the phone last week and we’d
just laughed it off. He’d never made a move or touched any of us
inappropriately as far as I knew, and he didn’t seem, in the parlance of today,
a predator—and if he was, so what? I could probably handle it even though I
didn’t want to. But Terry seemed to feel something was now allowable—I
had met him for lunch and he’d admitted something about himself and didn’t
have to pretend anymore. But my curiosity was clouding the situation. It
became unavoidable.
“What about Liz?” I asked.
“What about her?” Terry asked back.
I shrugged, looked down at the table. “What does she think?”
His tone didn’t change when he said, “You’re smarter than that, Bret.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“She has her suspicions, of course,” Terry said. “But I’m under the
impression that we have an understanding.” Terry tossed this off casually,
and then, tinged very lightly with irony, enunciated, “An arr-ange-ment.”
“That’s cool” was all I could think of to finally say, and I didn’t ask how
this explained away her drunken outbursts concerning Terry’s sexuality.
“What about Debbie?” Terry asked me, grinning. “Does she know about
your proclivities?”
“My proclivities?” I asked. “You mean that I’m not limited?”
“No, that you’re probably…bi,” Terry said. “As if such a thing exists.
Though I guess for the right price…” He looked at me when he said: “I heard
a rumor about Jeff Taylor.”
I noticed that David Hockney and his companion had gotten up from
their table and were looking over at Terry, who smiled and held up a hand.
That’s when I decided I needed to get out of Trumps. I looked at my watch.
“I should probably be going.”
“Why?” Terry asked. “Don’t you want to meet David?”
“I have a class,” I said. “And some after-school stuff back at Buckley.”
“Okay.” He watched as I stood up.
“Thanks for lunch, Terry,” I said. My heart was racing as I tried to act
super-casual but I was so disappointed. What had been accomplished? What
was the purpose of all this? The answer was: nothing.
“You barely ate,” Terry said, touching the stem of the wineglass,
swirling what was left of the Chardonnay. “Though I heard you had a
cocktail at the bar before I arrived.”
“Yeah, well.” I shrugged, then reached into my slacks for the valet ticket.
“Please don’t say anything to Debbie,” he reminded me, looking up.
“Isn’t that a little weird?” I couldn’t help but ask.
“Isn’t everything?” Terry said. “Oh, tell her, don’t tell her. I don’t think
you will.”
“Thanks for lunch,” I said again and turned away.
And then suddenly Terry grabbed my wrist. I stopped, stunned, and
looked down at him, my arm stretched out between us.
“I’ll have Steven call you and we can set up a time to start talking about
that script I want you to write for me,” Terry said quietly.

I’M GOING TO RECOUNT an incident that occurred in a space on Melrose,
the one Debbie mentioned the first day of school when I stood dazed in the
administration office realizing what the future entailed for me our senior
year: it was the space that didn’t have a name, the space that someone called
Attila had recommended, the space that just showed videos. And for the
longest time I connected that night to Robert Mallory, because it seemed to
exactly precede the series of events that began to alter and consume our lives
in the following weeks, a kind of macabre prologue to what ultimately
happened to us in the fall of 1981. I suppose I could now look at that night in
the space on Melrose from a different angle and not connect it directly to the
presence of Robert Mallory, and consider, rather, that this was an incident
solely about the deranged cult that drifted in from the high deserts southwest
of Los Angeles and began materializing on the streets and in the
neighborhoods of L.A. But in the end it didn’t matter what the angle was,
since the two—Robert and the cult—were ultimately intertwined.
—
THAT WEEK I’D BEEN reading an article about the cult in the Los Angeles
Times. A group of young, barely articulate hippies, formed out in the Mojave,
acolytes of a leader only referred to as “Bruce”—who turned out to be a highschool English teacher from Lancaster, fired due to “sexual improprieties”
with a number of female students—and it would normally have sounded
absurd and been dismissed as junior-level Manson stuff, but their persistence
in making themselves known and visible in L.A. was becoming slightly
chilling in its aggressiveness; many of them had been arrested for trespassing,
climbing over a gate to the backyard if no one answered the front entrance, or
if the bell the hippie eagerly pressed was ignored they’d walk around the
property, peering through windows, and then try the sliding glass doors,
banging on them until someone appeared in the kitchen and called the police;
sometimes they were found in someone’s pool or on a chaise longue in
Hancock Park and Silver Lake, tripping on acid, wreaths of leaves garlanded
as crowns around their heads, or sometimes they were hiding in the garage
wedged into a trash can, and a few of the men were involved in physical
altercations with people exiting grocery stores and movie theaters, restaurants
and parking lots, demanding money, berating anyone who wasn’t willing to
offer a few dollars. I remember there were three or four photos of various cult
members in the Los Angeles Times article and they looked slightly cleaner
than members of the Manson family and so young and harmless—but maybe
Los Angeles became more invested in this cult because of how wounded it
had been by the Tate-LaBianca murders and the damage inflicted on the
psyche of the city—and there was the same general ragtag scruffiness, the
dead-eyed youth, a kind of psychotic apathy behind whatever brainwashed
mission they conjured up. It was vague: unify, bring together, utopia, erase
pain, destroy status quo, the same tired slogans. They also believed in aliens
who could “heal” them and they were enthralled with peyote and Love is
everything, everything is nothing. This was the first time I’d read about the
cult, self-named Riders of the Afterlife; they’d been encountered from
Beachwood Canyon all the way to Ojai, but I’d never heard of them before.
And in that same issue of the Los Angeles Times there was a report of
another home invasion last Monday night in Woodland Hills. It was the
familiar narrative: phone calls in the preceding week, furniture rearranged, a
dog in the neighborhood missing for a few days; the victim was assaulted by
a figure in a black ski mask, the victim was tied to a chair and knocked
unconscious, a pattern was completed, the victim unaware that they had
found themselves in a pattern; otherwise they would have gone to the police
earlier. And for a moment I began to connect the home invasions with the
cult. I remember putting the paper down on that Thursday night and going
back to my novel, distracted and worried about the Riders of the Afterlife,
and wondering if they were responsible for the break-ins and the
disappearances that were haunting the city instead of just a lone intruder.
Maybe it was the eeriness of the article about the cult that activated my
imagination that night, because I kept thinking I heard someone in the house.
I was at my desk, working on the novel, and whenever I stopped typing I
would suddenly sit very still, positive that a presence either was lurking
outside the house or was actually somewhere within it. I’d try and push it out
of my mind but a number of times I thought I heard the doorbell or the
chiming that announced the garage doors were opening. I crept through the
house clutching a butcher knife, but no one was there.
—
AT NINE O’CLOCK on that Thursday night I jumped in my chair when I
heard a car pulling up the driveway and my heart started racing before it took
me a moment to calm down and realize that it was Debbie who had come to
pick me up and remember we were heading to the space on Melrose. I
grabbed my wallet and jogged out of the bedroom and down the hall and
walked straight out of the brightly lit house to where the BMW was parked in
the driveway. Debbie had just gotten out of the driver’s side and was standing
with the door open when she saw me bounding down the front steps. I was
wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and a burgundy V-neck sweater with a gold
Armani eagle emblazoned on its chest and Topsiders with no socks. It was
warm out.
“I was going to come in,” she said.
“Let’s just go,” I said, hurrying toward the car.
“Well, I wanted a drink.”
“Let’s just have one when we get there,” I said. “I want to get out of the
house.”
“Is something wrong?” she asked.
“No,” I muttered. “I just want to get out. It’s already nine.”
She waited a beat and decided not to push it. I opened the passenger door
and slid in. The car smelled of clove cigarettes and roses and when she
started the ignition “Tainted Love” blasted out, startling me and I jumped in
my seat—the second time that night. Debbie turned to me, amused.
“You’re…a little tense.” I forced myself to relax and smile lazily at her. “I’m
fine, babe,” I said in as suave a voice as I could muster. She turned the car
around and started pulling out of the driveway that led down to Mulholland,
deserted at nine on a Thursday night. She looked over at me before making a
left as if to confirm something. Annoyance briefly flared and I said, “Come
on, I’m fine.” She breathed in and said, “I didn’t say anything,” then turned
onto Mulholland, and soon we were passing Beverly Glen as we listened to a
mixtape I’d made (obscure tracks from Talking Heads’ Fear of Music, and
David Bowie’s Scary Monsters) and then we passed Coldwater Canyon, and
made a right onto Laurel, where Debbie raced down the winding road—
barely another car passed us that night—until we crossed Sunset and
Fountain and Santa Monica and finally hit Melrose.
It was now nine-thirty, and past Fairfax, Melrose was mostly a dark and
deserted stretch of storefronts—this section of Melrose hadn’t become totally
gentrified and except for the occasional retro clothing store there really
weren’t any other shops or restaurants, so it wasn’t hard to find an empty
parking spot on a Thursday night. I wondered how close the club we were
going to was located as Debbie did a couple of bumps from a small plastic
packet and then offered it to me—I declined. I couldn’t handle cocaine like
Debbie or even Thom Wright was able to—I couldn’t just do a bump or two
and let that take me through the party. I always craved more, which is why I
said no that night; there was never enough and we had school the next day.
When I got out of the BMW I looked both ways down the empty street and
had no idea where the space was: there was nothing to signify this
“happening” and “underground” location only a few knew about—no lights,
no sign, no people milling out in front—and though this was Debbie’s first
time at what came to be known only as “the space” she knew exactly where it
was and I walked with her until we came to a darkened storefront in the 7200
block. Debbie simply opened a metal door and walked in and I followed,
accompanied by the lone sound of a helicopter somewhere in the overcast
night sky.
—
THE OPENING OF “RAPTURE” BY Blondie was playing as we moved
down the entrance hall, where only a couple of bare lightbulbs illuminated a
concrete floor and Pepto-Bismol–pink walls, the paint peeling away in great
patches of black and silver, and Junior, a tall, thin Jamaican wearing a black
suit with a white shirt and a black tie and a porkpie hat, was sitting on a high
wooden stool and hugged Debbie while the dreamily ominous first verse of
“Rapture” played out softly past the doorman—I remember this so clearly
and I remember looking behind me to see if anyone was following us down
the hallway. I was introduced as “This is my boyfriend, Bret,” and then she
took my hand and led me into the room beyond the hallway, our movements
seemed to be choreographed by the song itself. It was so dimly lit that the
few people in the space, maybe only four or five, were just silhouettes,
shadows, you couldn’t fully see them—the only light source came from the
soft orange neon thinly piped along the bottom of the walls, giving the room
just enough of a faint glow to make sure you could navigate the space
without losing your equilibrium. Flat gray carpeting covered the floor and
made it feel as if you were moving across a darkened landscape through a
heavy mist. The other faint light came from six smaller rooms off to the sides
of the main space, each of them playing different videos. A green neon palm
tree and a pink neon flamingo affixed to the wall gave off the only light at the
bar situated between them and it was manned by a lone bartender, waiting,
immobile. “Rapture” kept playing as Debbie swayed to the music while we
ordered drinks—I had vodka-and-grapefruit and Debbie had a glass of
champagne and then lit a clove cigarette and said something to the bartender,
who she seemed to know and who gestured toward the darkness as I paid.
Debbie took my hand and wanted me to meet Jon, who had opened this space
and was in the back room, but I didn’t want to meet Jon, so I told her I was
going to check the space out, maybe watch some videos in the space, just
hang out in the space.
“Is that, like, okay?” I asked when I made out her expression in the green
glow coming from the palm tree. “Rapture” kept playing somewhere softly
above us, and Debbie shrugged and simply said, “Okay,” and headed to the
back of the space. It annoyed me that this disappointed Debbie but not
enough to accompany her to meet Jon.
I moved toward the door I was closest to and “Rapture” faded behind
me, replaced by the tom-tom-ing of Mick Fleetwood’s drum intro to “Tusk,”
which was the video playing in that room. There were no chairs, no furniture,
just a couple of ashtrays dotted the flat gray carpeting that lined the room
illuminated only by the video projected on the wall. Lindsey Buckingham’s
low ominous voice was asking Why don’t you tell me who’s on the phone? as
I sat on the floor and sipped my drink, watching the video, which was footage
of Fleetwood Mac recording the USC Marching Band in the summer of 1979
at a deserted Dodgers Stadium, palm trees set against the faded white sky
beyond the empty black scoreboard, and you glimpsed Christine McVie
holding a glass of white wine and Stevie Nicks looking hungover and puffy,
twirling a baton, and there was a cardboard cutout of John McVie propped in
the stands since the real one was in Hawaii, and the Spirit of Troy were in
their Roman gladiator attire. I sat up a little when I realized that Lindsey
Buckingham, in a new phase of his career, cleaned up, shaven, short-haired,
New Wave—the seventies were over—and wearing a white T-shirt and
sunglasses resembled almost exactly someone I knew and suddenly while
watching the video for what must have been the hundredth time without ever
noticing this before, I realized that person was Terry Schaffer. And I
suddenly found Terry Schaffer sexier in a new way because of how sexy I
now found Lindsey Buckingham.
I was so unnerved by this connection that I got up and quickly left the
room, muttering to myself. The same face, the same smile, the same color
hair, the same build—in the “Tusk” video Lindsey Buckingham resembled
Terry Schaffer in such an unsettling way that it changed my perception of
everything. And then I realized Terry Schaffer had actually introduced me to
Lindsey Buckingham backstage at the after party when Fleetwood Mac
played the Hollywood Bowl on the final night of the Tusk world tour, when
Terry and Debbie and Liz and Thom and Susan and I all sat in a box and ate
takeout from Pioneer Chicken and drank Taittinger from plastic flutes. Why
had I never made the connection before? I wandered through the main space
recovering from this realization; a few more people had arrived but you
couldn’t make anyone out, maybe when someone lit a cigarette, and then just
briefly. The only lights that guided you through the space were the flickering
doorways, where videos played, and the entrance, where Junior sat, which
acted like a beacon in the darkness. Someone brushed against me, then
disappeared into the mist, and it could have been a ghost.
—
I PASSED INTO ANOTHER EMPTY room, where Kim Wilde was about to
sing one of the pop glories from that year “Kids in America” and I sat on the
floor looking up at the video projected on the bare wall. It was so simple: a
synthesizer, a smoke machine, Kim Wilde’s blank blue-tinged face staring
straight at us, and like so many songs of that era it was an anthem, something
about being the kids in America, where everybody lives for the music-goround, but Kim sang it with a quiet determination, a girl who could handle
anything with her cool indifference: she didn’t get excited by the excitement
of the song. This is what gave the song an added tension: Kim remained
unsmiling through the soaring chorus—she was withdrawn, dead-eyed, even
drugged. Maybe she knew where she was, or maybe she didn’t know, maybe
she could have been anywhere—this was what became so suggestive in the
video. She was offering an invitation but she didn’t care if you came or not,
because she could always find somebody else. She was radiating that
numbness-as-a-feeling aesthetic I was so drawn to and trying to perfect in
Less Than Zero and I was thrilled seeing it embodied in the poppiest of
artifacts. And she also reminded me of Susan Reynolds to a degree—Susan
was far more beautiful than Kim Wilde; she was gorgeous by comparison—
because Susan also, increasingly, had a faraway demeanor that wasn’t
indifference exactly; it was really numbness as a come-on, something
alluring, something that Susan had developed for years and that was now
flowering. They both had it in their eyes, the way their mouths were set, their
overall non-expressiveness—and it was hot. I also knew that someone as
earnest as Thom Wright would never survive it. But someone like Robert
Mallory might thrive.
I suddenly thought again: as a writer, you’re always hearing things that
aren’t there.
And then I flashed on: When you talk to me you’re really talking to
yourself, dude. I was still haunted by it.
I looked away from the video and stood up and walked back into the
main room. But I immediately stopped because, as if on cue, I saw Jeff
Taylor with Robert Mallory talking to Junior at the end of the lighted hallway
before you descended into the darkness of the space, and the doorman was
checking a list even though I had the feeling that Jeff knew him and, of
course, I realized, it was Debbie who had invited Robert Mallory and I
thought: God, he’s really a part of us now. Watching him from my hidden
vantage point, I also thought about how sometimes he filled me with dread
and other times there were flashes when I wanted to kiss him and have him
fuck me and the fear and the sex were rarely separated. And then there were
the darker moments where I imagined how insane he really was even though
none of us knew anything yet; this was just the writer’s intuition, the writer’s
hunch, based heavily on one lie he told—we didn’t know the other lies yet.
—
I WATCHED as Jeff and Robert walked past Junior and into the space and
were subsumed by the misty darkness—it concealed everything. They
couldn’t see me—I was just a few feet away—as Jeff led Robert toward the
bar and I turned and went into another, random room, where I fell to the
floor, prone on my stomach, and finished my drink. On the wall Roxy Music
was singing “Same Old Scene” and I laid my head down on folded arms and
could smell how new the carpet was as I waited—there were still so few
people in the space that I knew it was only a matter of minutes before Jeff
and Robert would locate me. And then I wondered if Thom and Susan were
coming and realized I hadn’t even asked Debbie, because it never occurred to
me that they wouldn’t be coming, but now I had my doubts and—because
Robert was here—I hoped they weren’t. I remembered I hadn’t asked
because I was just so relieved to be in Debbie’s BMW moving away from the
empty house on Mulholland and concentrating on the mixtape I’d made her
in August, the car’s air conditioning lightly causing my breath to steam, my
eyes fixated on the road outside the windshield, hoping Debbie wouldn’t say
anything.
I rolled onto my back because suddenly Jeff was standing over me
prodding my shoulder with a Topsider. “You wasted already?”
I smiled at him, just lying there, and nodded even though I wasn’t.
“Cool,” he said approvingly. “Where’s Debbie? It’s dark as fuck in
here.”
“She’s in back,” I said.
“With Jon?” Jeff asked.
“I guess,” I said, and then noticed Robert’s head over Jeff’s shoulder. He
offered a little wave and a goofy smile.
“Take care of this guy,” Jeff said to Robert. “I’ll be back.”
A wave of apprehension crashed over me at being left alone with Robert
and I was suddenly paralyzed as he smiled and sat down in a lotus position;
he was holding a Corona and sizing me up. I felt vulnerable and tried to sit
but I couldn’t, something wouldn’t let me, so I simply rolled onto my
stomach and stared as another video started: “I Got You” by Split Enz, the
song Debbie and I made out to the night she initiated our relationship at
Anthony Matthews’s house at the beginning of summer, and when I glanced
over, Robert was looking up at the wall, bopping his head to the ominous
thumping beat that opened the song and played throughout. He then lay down
next to me so that we were side by side and I instantly became distracted—he
was close enough to kiss, for me to reach over and run my hand over the rise
of his ass, I could smell him. This feeling wasn’t remotely pleasurable—it
was just a basic hunger that couldn’t be waylaid or stopped. The lead singer,
Neil Finn, at the height of his twenty-year-old beauty, was in a suit and
heavily made up, singing in a room, standing by a pair of French doors, the
curtains lit blue and lightly billowing, and shadows patterned the wall where
a “painting” hung of the band, everyone dressed in the New Wave suits of
that moment, and the band would come alive when the soaring chorus played
after the eerie minor-chord verse—it was another anthem, yet this one was
tinged with fear.
“What are you doing here?” I finally asked, without looking at him.
“Debbie invited me,” I heard him say.
“Oh yeah? Cool,” is all I said. I could smell the lotion he used, the
shampoo, cologne, cedar and sandalwood, it seemed adult, something a
teenager wouldn’t wear.
“Yeah, Thom’s coming, too,” he added.
“Is Susan?” I asked apprehensively.
“No,” he said and then turned to me. “Just Thom.”
We watched the video. Pairs of eyes were superimposed over Neil Finn,
who was trying to hide, and then he joined the band in the painting while also
standing in the room and for some reason I was never entirely sure of he
starts to collapse with dread—because he sees himself entrapped in the
painting while he’s still standing in the room, I always guessed, even though I
also thought: What’s so bad about that? The volume was low enough that I
could hear Robert say something as the song faded out. And then the video
started playing again.
I turned to look at him. “What?”
“Why didn’t you end up with her?” he asked, staring up at the images
projected on the wall.
“Who?” I asked back, blinking, confused.
“Susan,” he said softly.
“Because Thom did,” I automatically answered. “What?” I was annoyed
—I didn’t want to talk about Susan with Robert. And then I wondered: who
else did he talk to about her?
“Yeah, but why didn’t you?” he asked. “I mean Thom’s not the most
scintillating dude.”
I was shocked that Robert said this about Thom. “He has other…
attributes,” I said lamely, defending my friend.
Robert mimicked me, laughing. “He has other attributes.”
“Are you okay?” I asked him.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he said, glancing at me and then back up at the video.
“Really?” I asked. “Are you?”
“Yeah. Why? Thought you saw me somewhere again?” he asked with a
wink.
I was so close to telling him we knew about the “developmental center”
in Jacksonville where he was a patient in the spring of his junior year but I
couldn’t because of the promise we’d made to Susan—the secret we shared. I
looked back up at the video. Just to do something, I lifted the plastic cup and
tossed some of the ice at the bottom into my mouth and started chewing,
acting casual, pretending Robert wasn’t upsetting me with the direction he
was taking this conversation. And then he asked, “Are you okay?”
“Oh yeah,” I said. “I’m good.”
“Really?” he asked. “I heard you had a…falling out.”
Despair flushed through me. “A falling out?”
“Yeah,” he said. “With your buddy Matt.”
Tendrils of panic started drifting out from the despair, creating their own
unique sensation. I kept chewing the ice, trying to remain casual.
“I asked him the other day why he seemed…freaked out,” Robert said.
“Well, not exactly freaked out. But, yeah…” He reconsidered but then
decided not to. “Freaked out, I guess.”
“And what did he say?” I asked tonelessly. Robert always made you
aware that ignoring him wasn’t allowed as an option.
“That he had a falling out with a friend,” Robert said.
“How do you know that’s me?” I asked, with a slight shiver of relief. No
name. A friend.
“I just assumed,” he said softly.
“No, not at all,” I said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Robert realized something: he intuited I was lying. “That’s how you’re
going to play it?” he asked softly.
I remember nodding to myself, riding along with the game, and forcing a
smile. “Yes, that’s how I’m going to play it.”
“Oh,” he said. “Okay.”
The video was suddenly ending again, the song was fading out, the wall
became white. We waited for another video to begin. He turned onto his side.
“You never answered me,” Robert said. “Why you didn’t end up with
Susan.”
“What do you want to know?”
“I heard you were there first,” he said.
“Because Thom came around.”
“But why weren’t you with her instead?” he asked.
I realized something and swallowed hard.
“I didn’t want to lose a friend,” I said.
“But didn’t you lose Matt?” Robert asked softly.
I didn’t say anything, just stared at him. I was disoriented, dizzy. I
needed another drink to blot out the pain that suddenly shot through me.
“I don’t get it. About Susan,” Robert said. “Didn’t you want to? I don’t
get it.” He positioned himself on his back, a leg crossed over a knee.
“Didn’t I want to what?” I asked, completely unnerved, sitting up.
He shrugged. “Squeeze those titties? Suck and bite those titties?” he
asked softly. He waited. “I bet her wet pussy tastes pretty sweet.”
I sat there and looked at him blankly. But he wasn’t looking at me. He
was just lying on his back, surrounded by the flat gray carpeting, and staring
up at the ceiling.
“I don’t know about you, Bret, but I’d love to put my tongue up that tight
little pussy, all pink and wet,” Robert murmured, lost in his own reverie.
“Little honey pot.”
I became aroused hearing Robert talk like this but also repelled because
he was talking about Susan.
“Yeah,” he was saying. “I’d really like to fuck her in the ass. Really fuck
that ass hard. Make her scream for it.”
At this point I just pushed myself up and walked out of the room.
“Hey, where are you going?” I heard Robert calling out.
I wasn’t a prude: I was drawn to porn and sometimes talked dirty to Matt
Kellner while we had sex and I knew someone who fooled around with Ron
Levin for cash and made no judgments but I’d never been part of a
conversation where someone detailed what they would do to a friend of mine
sexually and what made it so awful was that Robert was someone I barely
knew. A young actress or a pop singer was usually the norm, the target, for
this kind of guy talk, rather than a girl you knew, but never bragging about
what you’d do to them in the particularly explicit way Robert had, because it
was trashy and low-class. And it wasn’t as if I even cared about decorum or
rules or propriety—I was a writer: I believed everyone had a voice and could
say whatever they wanted, and sometimes I’d wished that Thom talked more
about sex than he ever did or that Ryan wasn’t so circumspect or that the
conversations in the boys’ locker room were rowdier and more gleefully
obscene, but Buckley didn’t encourage this, and that night in the space on
Melrose I was glad it didn’t. The way Robert Mallory said this about Susan
—it was only two or three lines—relieved me that we were all somewhat
apprehensive about expressing ourselves in such a grotesque way. I also
remember thinking that I should have stayed in the room with Robert and
talked him through this so I could have a better inkling of what his plans for
Susan Reynolds actually were, because I knew he was going to act on them
and I was afraid for Susan and I wanted to be prepared. But I also knew: she
was going to throw a party for him, she had found him electrifying, she was
going to let herself get lost in his madness, and everything would get ruined. I
was shaking, furious, when I left the room.
—
I MOVED into the space and walked up to the bar and asked the bartender
where the bathrooms were and he pointed to a barely illuminated EXIT sign at
the back of the room and I made my way past a few clusters of shadows, the
orange ash from the tips of cigarettes the only props that confirmed people
existed in the darkness, because you couldn’t see faces and everything was
vaguely hushed, even with Madness singing above us. I remember that I
didn’t get what the point of the space was: on one level, I supposed it was
cool—because Debbie Schaffer knew about it—but what was the point if you
couldn’t see anyone and there was no dancing and the only thing to do was sit
in an empty room on the floor and watch videos from 1980. And I remember
being annoyed that I would have to confront Debbie about inviting Robert
because of how unstable he was and yet I remember pausing when I planned
to do this because Robert’s instability hadn’t fully proven itself yet to anyone
else and I didn’t know what could set him off. I don’t like being followed, he
told me in the Galleria—I had taken note of that.
I remember that once I’d parted the black curtain below the EXIT sign I
suddenly heard Debbie’s faraway voice and the muffled sound of male
laughter, coming from wherever Jon’s office was—I heard Jeff Taylor’s
hyena giggle as well. I moved down a hallway lined with windows that
looked over a small parking lot where an alley traversed parallel to Melrose
and the hallway was lit by the streetlamps that illuminated the alley. There
were no cars in the parking lot except for a beige van situated in the last
parking space and no one in the hallway waiting for the one unisex bathroom.
A white candle was lit next to the sink, so you could only make out the toilet
and the urinal but nothing else, and it smelled as if it had been recently
cleaned. I couldn’t find the light switch to brighten the space, so I closed the
door and locked it and walked over to the urinal illuminated by the candle.
Another question I almost immediately asked myself: why would a
mirror in a bathroom be almost completely ensconced in darkness at a
nightclub for young people—girls who wanted to touch up their makeup,
boys who wanted to check out their hair? But maybe there was a point to the
space that I wasn’t grasping yet, maybe it was partly a prank, the anti-scene,
the wry commentary on how you could make anything seem fashionable to
L.A.’s young and hip if you just made it exclusive enough. Maybe the space
was performance art conjured up by older hipsters taking advantage of the
naïveté of the city’s youth. But then I doubted this, because Debbie was so
plugged in and would have told me the space was a joke, not real, something
to be amused by, a one-shot, and she hadn’t.
I unzipped my jeans and stood at the urinal, and sensed that the
bathroom, despite the darkness, was much larger than I even first
presupposed—when I initially flushed the urinal its sound echoed farther into
a darkness than I originally imagined. It was completely silent as I
contemplated my shadow wavering against the wall and tried to relax—I
couldn’t hear anything from the space, no music, no muffled sound, and I
should’ve been relaxed enough to urinate, but Robert Mallory had hyped me
up and I was still tense from our encounter. I remember that I breathed in and
thought about how much progress I’d made on the novel and looked forward
to new movies I wanted to see, Ryan Vaughn, calm blue ocean—but these
thoughts were interrupted by: should I tell anyone that I thought the
desecration of the Buckley Griffin was connected to Robert Mallory—that he
had vandalized it—and that he was planning on fucking Susan Reynolds in
the ass until she screamed? I exhaled, relaxed, tried again.
And then I realized something. I wasn’t alone in the bathroom.
—
I REALIZED THAT SOMEONE was also in there, with me, in the darkness.
And I remember how I froze when I started hearing a faint whispering
coming from one of the darkened corners behind me, and it sounded low to
the floor, as if whoever the whispering emanated from was crouched down.
“Hello?” I asked with a jolt of adrenaline. I immediately zipped up.
I remember that I turned around but couldn’t see anything—just the area
illuminated by the candle. There was a larger room beyond that lit area, I now
realized.
The whispering continued.
“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t know someone was in here.”
No one answered or said anything.
Instead a voice began whispering what sounded like an incantation,
repeating phrases over and over, almost as if they had to eagerly convince
themselves of whatever it was they were desperately incanting, a series of
garbled sounds, in a language I didn’t recognize, but in the five seconds I
stood there in the darkness I realized that it wasn’t a language—it was just
gibberish, nothing. I don’t know why, but I was bold enough to pick up the
candle and near the voice in the darkness—it kept breathlessly incanting and
then wheezing inward and there was another rush of infantile rambling and I
remember it became daunting how deep the bathroom seemed. I had walked
maybe eight full steps, holding the candle up, until I saw a shadow crouched
in the corner.
“Hey. What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice managing to stay
calmly inquisitive.
I moved the candle closer until a pale young face was looking up at me,
bearded, grinning, floating in the darkness, and his hair was matted blond,
dusted with what looked like twigs and dead leaves, and his eyes were
crinkled shut as he kept grinning and incanting, like an idiot, swaying back
and forth on his haunches, and he was barefoot. I thought this was someone
legitimately retarded or severely handicapped but then he stopped whispering
and his face bolted up at mine completely serious and I remember his eyes
opened and widened and the smile turned threatening. I saw his hands were
dirt-stained and the nails were so long they resembled yellowed talons. I
remember backing away, and then dropping the candle, which cracked on the
floor and sputtered out, plunging us into darkness, and on instinct, I quickly
slammed myself against the wall, clawing toward the direction of the door,
grabbing for the handle and unlocking it, and raced out of the blackness of
the restroom.
—
I REMEMBER THAT I walked straight back into the space, where I told the
bartender there was someone—maybe a homeless guy—who had crashed the
club and was in the bathroom. “Some freak is in there who doesn’t belong”
was how I put it exactly, spitting this out—and what a strange way to word
what had happened, I now realize, sounding more pissed off than scared. I
remember a song by a band called Spider, “New Romance,” was playing
lightly throughout the space as the bartender disappeared into the sparsely
populated darkness and reappeared where Junior was standing in the light.
The bartender relayed what I’d told him and then the two of them crossed
through the darkness to the bar and the three of us headed toward the black
curtain below the EXIT sign.
And I remember the moment we parted the curtain we heard a scream.
In the hallway a blonde girl was nearing us, her hands held up, her face
lightly streaked with blood that was quickly spurting from a thin line drawn
across her forehead as she staggered down the hallway, the door to the
bathroom open behind her, the gibbering now a kind of elongated screeching.
“He’s in there!” I remember whisper-yelling, pointing. Junior gently took the
girl’s arm, guiding her away from the bathroom and asking what happened.
She said she didn’t know: she went into the restroom, wondering where the
lights were, and felt something swipe across her face, scratching her.
I watched the bartender walk to the open door with no trepidation and
reach in and find the light switch. Immediately the bathroom was illuminated
and the hippie rushed at him, the gibbering now incensed and high-pitched. I
remember that Debbie had appeared behind me with Jeff and a guy I assumed
was Jon, everyone gasping with confusion as the bartender easily pushed the
hippie against a wall and then put him in a headlock and dragged him out of
the bathroom. The hippie was squealing and thrashing around until he landed
in the hallway, where the bartender threw him to the floor. The bartender told
Jon to call the police: there was an intruder, get an ambulance. I remember
the girl realized something and said she was okay and didn’t need an
ambulance. And even though it was just a very thin scratch from where the
hippie’s nail had swiped at her in the darkness it wouldn’t stop bleeding as
Junior kept pressing paper towels against her forehead that quickly became
stained red. “It doesn’t hurt,” she said, as if annoyed. “But it doesn’t hurt,” I
remember she kept saying. Debbie and Jeff were asking me what the fuck
happened and Jon had already called the police and then conferred with
Junior and the bartender, who had his foot on the hippie’s back, waiting for
the police to arrive. I remember that the hippie was looking up at us, pressed
against the floor, still whispering incantations, drool slathering his chin, his
yellowed teeth bared like he was some kind of animal, and yet what bothered
me was that no one seemed particularly frightened of him.
—
DEBBIE REALIZED SHE VAGUELY KNEW the girl and went over to
where she was standing and asked who she’d come with, and then Debbie left
to find the friends as Junior kept pressing paper towels to the girl’s forehead.
Red and blue lights flashed through the windows of the hallway and Jon let
the two officers in from the back door and the hippie was handcuffed and
hauled out to one of the squad cars in the parking lot and then it was simply
over: a girl had been scratched by an intruder who climbed in through an
unlocked window, that was it. I remember that the bleeding finally stopped,
and the girl was soon standing in front of the mirror, her two friends had
joined her, and you could barely see the thin red scratch above her eyebrow
—the bleeding had stopped but one of the friends urged her to go to the ER
because the scratch might be infected. The girl didn’t want to—she seemed
annoyed and just asked if anyone had coke. I drifted with Debbie and Jeff
through the black curtain and out into the space, which was completely
undisturbed by whatever happened in the bathroom and hallway. I remember
music was still playing but louder now—Tim Curry, “I Do the Rock”—and
the space was filled with more shadows, some of them swaying in the middle
of the semi-deserted room, and seemingly no one knew what had happened in
the hallway at the back of the space. The bartender was making drinks again
as if nothing had occurred and I grabbed a vodka-and-grapefruit and Debbie
disappeared into the darkness with another friend, who wanted to do some
blow, and I found a room where I sat down and I remember being calmly
elated: this was something I could write about, this was an incident I could
place into the narrative of the novel I was working on, and I began to think of
ways to embellish it—paint it darker, give it an eerier vibe, push evil. I
thought about adding the stench of shit from the pile of excrement the hippie
had laid out, the knife he was now clutching, a deeper wound inflicted upon
the girl, more blood. I wasn’t even looking at the video projected on the wall
because I was dreaming a different one.
—
I DIDN’T KNOW THAT someone had been trailing me in the darkness but
then Thom Wright pushed me over and I fell onto the carpet, where he
playfully tackled me, Jeff Taylor urging him on—this was how Thom
sometimes showed affection when he was a little high. He had downed a
couple of tequila shots and snorted two bumps of Debbie’s coke, and I
wrestled with him while he kept trying to tickle me. We were both laughing,
his hard body writhing over mine, when he suddenly lifted himself off my
chest, panting—Thom had no idea I was getting an erection—because
suddenly one of our favorite videos started playing and we looked up to it
projected on the wall. The video was mostly in black and white and it was a
song about a brief love affair in Vienna and minimalist, with just the slow
beat of a drum machine and a mournful piano and synth bass. We had seen
the images hundreds of times and they still entranced us: a horse moving
through the fog on a cobblestone street, flashes of lightning, the lead singer in
a trench coat, an empty city, Vienna in the off-season but also North London,
gargoyles. There were the eighties video staples that hadn’t become clichés
yet: a fancy party in an embassy, a candelabra on a white baby grand beneath
a chandelier, martinis drunk by grotesques shot in fish-eye lens, a tarantula
crawling across the face of a passed-out guest, an ominous child playing a
violin. There were lovers discovered by paparazzi, and someone shot to death
on the grand curving staircase of an opera house. The feeling has gone, the
singer cried out. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. The final
chorus climaxes with a cymbal crash and it always gave me chills. Oh,
Vienna.
The song was too slow, it was too long, and yet it moved us and like the
best pop songs it was an abstraction, poetry that could mean anything to
anyone—it was a launching pad for our separate longings but it was
obviously a metaphor about loss, and this was something all of us shared,
whether it was the pain Thom Wright’s parents’ divorce caused him, with the
father he was closer to now long gone across the continent, or the alcoholism
that was destroying Jeff Taylor’s father, or my own defeats tied to the actor I
often played and didn’t want to and who my own father still ignored even as I
kept trying to enact the part of a son I thought he wanted. This particular
Ultravox song seemed to, obliquely, sum everything up and it defined us in
that moment no matter what the lyrics or the video was actually about. We all
stayed silent until it was over.
The last thing I remember from that night in the space was Thom Wright
and Robert Mallory lying side by side in one of the rooms, where I joined
them. The video for Duran Duran’s “Girls on Film” was playing and I was
standing in the back and watched Robert leaning over and whispering to
Thom Wright—who was gripping a Corona bottle, nodding at whatever he
was being told, high and innocent—and I imagined he was urging Thom on
to the same dark wavelength Robert Mallory himself resided.
9
AFTER THE HORROR OF 1981 the numbness I had found exhilarating
during my sophomore and junior and into my senior years hardened
ultimately into a remote coldness that took decades to finally thaw. I was
never really the same after 1981—there was never a recovery period—and I
can now mark the moment when I was last happy, or more specifically where
the last traces of happiness, even a warmth, actually existed before I tripped
into fear and paranoia and began to understand how the adult world actually
operated compared to my adolescent fantasies of how I supposed it worked.
And it was the weekend that Ryan Vaughn spent with me at the house on
Mulholland when it was mid-September and we were seventeen, a weekend
before Matt Kellner disappeared, a weekend before Julie Selwyn’s body was
found, and everything changed. This weekend with Ryan, flat and uneventful
and resolutely peaceful until it briefly wasn’t, became the demarcation
between innocence and, for lack of any better word and trying not to sound
too dramatic, corruption. It’s not as if there weren’t other weekends in my life
that possessed a calmness or even verged on the blandly pleasant—days
where I forgot about that year long enough to enjoy myself—it’s just that
they were always tinged with the knowledge of what happened to us that fall.
For example, in the late summer of 1982, after I graduated from Buckley,
I spent the last weeks of August on the shores of Lake Tahoe in a house my
aunt had rented and where I remember walking through forests every day,
mentally preparing to leave Los Angeles behind—finally, excitedly—and
start a new life back east, beginning with Vermont and a small liberal-arts
school in the town of Bennington, and then to Manhattan: this was the plan
and I spent those weeks in August clearheaded because of the ensuing escape
(…time for me to fly…), but I was always aware that someone was watching
me, that Robert Mallory was somehow back, and I could soon feel his
presence whenever I roamed the empty trails with my Walkman on or swam
alone in the lake or was tanning on the deserted deck that led out to the pier.
A weekend I remember so clearly because of the freedom that was being
promised became a weekend, instead, shrouded with doubt: I would always
remember a wall streaked with blood in a high-rise condo and the adjacent
balcony splashed with it, I realized.
—
THERE WAS A WEEKEND soon after that, in October of 1982, when my
parents met me in New York. My father had just completed a real-estate deal
that moved him into another realm of wealth and he had flown up from
Pittsburgh, where the sale had been conducted, while my mother flew in from
Los Angeles to celebrate and aim for reconciliation—they had been separated
on-and-off for two years—and I took the train down from Bennington so we
could attempt to become a family again. We stayed at the Carlyle, we saw
Cats in previews at the Winter Garden, my father’s newly hired art adviser
encouraged him to check out the show of a young painter named Julian
Schnabel in SoHo, we ate at Le Cirque. I remained drunk most of the time,
presenting the new identity I’d formed at Bennington to my relieved parents,
and through that whirlwind weekend, filled with musicals and restaurants,
shopping at Gucci and flitting through art galleries, my parents’ presence was
a constant reminder of Los Angeles, a place I wanted to forget. And again I
had become fearful I was being watched, whether I walked through Barneys
or along the edges of Central Park or at the crowded bar in P. J. Clarke’s—I
never got over the feeling that Robert Mallory was somewhere, holding a pair
of binoculars, or looking at me through a telescope, constantly locating and
monitoring me, from somewhere.
There was a weekend that still haunts me from the summer of 1991,
when I rented a cottage on the beach in Wainscott. I’d embarked on a
relationship—really, my first—with a Southern lawyer who worked on Wall
Street only a few years older than me, and it seemed happiness might finally
announce itself, after I’d tried to forget about that autumn a decade behind
me, and it came close mainly because of the distraction of endless sex while
“Losing My Religion” strummed constantly throughout the cottage, REM’s
Out of Time being the record we played most that summer, but I ran into
someone from L.A. at a party in Amagansett that third weekend in the
Hamptons who recognized me and knew about the events at Buckley in 1981
—the guy was my age and had graduated from the Harvard School for Boys
the same year—and drunkenly asked about what really happened to Robert
Mallory, and Thom Wright and Susan Reynolds, and everything immediately
got ruined. I knew I would never forget a dead girl found mutilated in a
soundproofed basement or the blood-splattered condo in that Century City
high-rise where everything ended up devolving into ruin, and certainly not
the faint pale scars that crisscrossed my chest I was so self-conscious about.
The lawyer and I left Wainscott earlier than planned, as if there was
someplace else to escape.
—
THERE WERE TWO weekends in 2008 that in my mind thematically led
into each other, and one played out more as a metaphor than something
tangible and tactile. The first was spent at the Hearst Castle, where I had
accepted, along with a dozen other guests, an invitation from Jay McInerney
and his wife, Anne Hearst, to spend the weekend and where I drove up the
coast from Los Angeles to San Simeon on Friday, September 12, with a
younger guy I wasn’t serious about who I met in West Hollywood. Once you
were there it was almost impossible to get phone reception and after a while
you just stopped looking, so the weekend, lavish and decadent, spent
swimming in the Roman Pool at sunset while drinking Dom Pérignon and
eating beluga caviar, passed by with us having no idea what was about to
happen in the real world. As we drove down the coast on Monday the 15th
we learned that Lehman Brothers had officially gone bankrupt and financial
markets across the globe were collapsing—the disconnect between that
weekend spent in a gilded bubble and the actual reality of the messy world
acted as a metaphor for me as a writer that I haven’t been able to shake off.
And I mention it only because, strangely enough, it led to the following
weekend, which I spent in Palm Springs at the behest of a producer I was
writing a script for who put me up at the Parker, where I was one of only
three or four guests because of what happened with the financial markets—
everyone had fled. The Parker was kept open and ghostly, the grounds
entirely devoid of life, and I would sit in the empty dining room after
spending a day with the producer at his home in the movie colony working
on a script that would never be made, months wasted on a project that hadn’t
even paid that well but I was promised I could direct (this was the added
incentive), and all I could think about that weekend in 2008 was running into
Susan Reynolds at Las Casuelas, a Mexican restaurant on North Palm
Canyon Drive, at one point during the fall of our senior year and how I’d
made a promise to her there about a secret she needed kept, something I
could never tell Thom Wright.
And I remember the weekend with Ryan Vaughn in September of 1981
at the empty house on Mulholland, because it was the last weekend untainted
by the past. The basic reason why the weekend happened was, I realize in
retrospect, sex, and the hope tied to the sex. It was about desire in its simplest
form, and a purity that I would never experience again.
—
IT HAPPENED SO easily, with no drama, none of the “subterfuge” that
Ryan had hinted at, and no planning. Ryan and I were by the lockers on that
Friday afternoon and he simply said, “I’m going to spend the weekend at
your house,” and I responded with “Yeah, that’s great.” He looked at me and
then made the What’s up? face, our parodic expression of tense helplessness
—bug-eyed with surprise, lips pulled back, something we might have seen in
a Devo video—and I lightly laughed as I lifted a book from the locker and
then he said, “I’ll see you sometime tonight,” and turned and walked away.
That was it. I don’t like to admit this but I started shaking in front of the
opened locker and it took more than a moment to control it—the trembling
came from lust and the fact that I knew what was going to occur, finally,
between the two of us, something more than just the quick blow job and jerkoff that happened in August. On one level very little actually occurred that
weekend: we barely left the house, there was not a lot of conversation, the
NFL season had started and there were football games on Sunday that Ryan
wanted to watch, we went to the market at the Beverly Glen Centre only
once, to pick up two six-packs of Corona and a couple of steaks, which we
grilled Saturday night, mostly relying on the premade food Rosa had left in
the refrigerator. The weekend was, however, mostly devoted to sex and
everything else seemed to revolve around it. Each day was punctuated by sex;
sex was what defined the weekend.
Ryan arrived around six on Friday, parking the Trans Am in the
driveway and carrying a duffel bag over his shoulder as he walked toward the
house. I remembered how strange it always seemed to look at Ryan Vaughn
not in his Buckley uniform—it was how I was used to him—but also on that
Friday it was even stranger to see him finally reduced by desire and the
nervousness in trying to hide it and I could feel something strained between
us as I walked him into the house, which he had only been to twice before.
And I was nervous too—you could hear the nervousness in our voices and the
distant ways we were dealing with each other. He put the duffel bag down
and petted Shingy, who was leaping around Ryan, the dog wagging its tail
frantically, uselessly excited by Ryan’s presence, and it seemed that Ryan
was grateful to have this distraction for a moment while he figured out where
this was all going, and then said he wanted to take a swim. This was the
prelude to sex, I realized: the removal of clothes, the cleansing of the body. I
was already in a bathing suit and a T-shirt and I walked out to the backyard
with him as he kicked off his Topsiders and pulled the Polo shirt over his
head and then unzipped his jeans and tugged them off, leaving the white
jockey shorts on. He gracefully dived into the pool and quickly swam its
length, smiling at me as just his head sliced across the water until he turned
around and glided across the pool with another lap. I was now sitting in the
Jacuzzi watching him, hoping the warm water would calm me, because I was
too keyed up, too horny, and I realized one of us was going to have to make
that first suggestion so we could move past this almost intolerable state of
expectation, and I doubted Ryan was going to initiate it. I got out of the
Jacuzzi and told Ryan I was going to take a shower. He silently swam to the
edge of the pool, rested his arms on the tiled coping and nodded, just grinning
blankly.
“Okay, I’ll be there in a minute,” he said.
—
I WAS HAVING TROUBLE controlling my breathing as I walked across the
lawn to the deck that led to my room, where I opened the door and stepped in
and just stood still for a moment, staring at the bed and the light-gray
comforter stretched tight over the king-sized mattress. When I came out of
the shower Ryan was in the doorway pulling off his wet jockey shorts and I
walked up to him, a towel wrapped around my waist, and our mouths locked
together in a sudden hungry kiss and I dropped the towel. He pulled back,
trying not to trip over the wet jockey shorts entangled around an ankle, and
when he finally kicked it off, he briefly stood still, tall and casually muscled,
not bulky but lean, almost completely smooth except for the tufts coming
from his armpits and the light blond hair on his forearms and the bush where
his pink cock was sticking straight up almost parallel to the abdominal
muscles that ran up his taut, hard stomach. I reached for his cock and he
reached for mine. The sex wasn’t based on anything except an overwhelming
need and that’s why it was so intense that weekend: it just had to happen,
there was a physical logic to it—it wasn’t about dreams or friendship or love
or romance. It was, in fact, methodical and we were prepared. We knew this
wasn’t a fantasy: beach towels were laid across my bed so we wouldn’t stain
the sheets with baby oil, this was the first time I showed Ryan how to use an
enema, we took turns fucking with a small vibrator I’d bought at the Sex
Shoppe on Ventura Boulevard before we carefully guided our own cocks into
each other. The one time Ryan and I’d been together had been exciting but
rushed, and on that Friday in September we took our time.
The surprise, for me, was not how horny we were but how badly we
wanted to give each other pleasure—unlike with Matt, sex with Ryan was an
unexpectedly sensual experience, he was curious and relaxed and the sex
played out longer because we wanted it to, there was no need to hurry and get
it over with, because we had all weekend, there was no time limit. And there
was nothing but the sex: there was no domestic situation playing itself out, no
guilty conversations about what we were doing, no one was racked with
anxiety, neither one of us inhabited a particular role, no one was only passive,
no one was only dominant—I fucked Ryan the same amount of times he
penetrated and fucked me and often we switched off, took turns fucking each
other in the same session until both of us were aching to ejaculate and
couldn’t hold it in any longer. And I was amazed looking down on his
muscled back flexing with a sheen of sweat while he was on all fours, his
pale ass spread open, allowing my cock to slide in and out of him while he
muttered obscenities urging me on, that Matt Kellner didn’t exist anymore—
Ryan had erased him.
—
RYAN PLAYED BOB SEGER’S Against the Wind that weekend and Bruce
Springsteen’s The River and we watched Flash Gordon on the Z Channel,
making sexy jokes about Sam Jones, who we both thought was and wasn’t
hot—we went back and forth, we couldn’t tell, something about the hair, a
debate about his costume. We lived in the bed and in the pool and in the
living room that weekend, just the two of us, and I ignored phone calls from
Susan and my mother, who was somewhere in Greece. Debbie called and we
only talked briefly—she threatened to come over after I told her that I wasn’t
feeling well and I’d see her Monday morning at Buckley, but this only
worried her: “You’re not feeling well? Do you know what’s wrong? Are you
okay?” I assured Debbie that everything was fine but that I wanted to go back
to sleep and finally got her to hang up, and then realized something, and I
remember pulling my mom’s Jaguar out of the garage and backing it onto the
driveway to let Ryan park his Trans Am in her space instead, and closing the
garage door, in case Debbie came by unannounced. “That was a good idea,”
Ryan said, pulling me into the hallway, and kissing me deeply as I became
instantly erect. We stumbled toward the bedroom. Later, we were soaking in
the Jacuzzi, slightly buzzed from Coronas, and we were about to make dinner
but languid from the sex, and were just staring at each other, only Ryan’s
head and shoulders above the bubbling water, his blond hair wet and
darkened and slicked back. It was night now and Ryan murmured he was
getting hungry and then I asked him something, genuinely curious how he
would answer. I remember “Thunder Island” by Jay Ferguson was playing
from the outside speakers.
“What do you think of Robert Mallory?”
“The new guy?” Ryan asked. “He’s a good-looking guy, why?”
I hated the way he said this as if it wasn’t something he had to think
about or process. It was apparently so obvious that this response came out of
his mouth automatically. I breathed in. “Yeah, I guess.”
He noticed the way I sighed. “What? Is something wrong?” He tipped his
head back until he was floating, one of his feet brushing against my chest; he
kept his toe pressed against a nipple, smiling as if he was proud of himself—
Ryan’s confidence was a turn-on, animal and masculine.
“No, nothing, yeah, he’s pretty good-looking,” I said quickly, and then,
after a prolonged beat, where I grabbed his calf and held it in both hands,
said, “I think Thom is maybe getting too close to him.” I wasn’t sure if this
was exactly true but I was haunted by the way Thom and Robert lay next to
each other on the carpet below the Duran Duran video in the space on
Melrose and I threw this out there to see how Ryan would react.
“Too close?” Ryan asked, raising an eyebrow, pulling his leg away.
“What does that mean?”
I paused, looked up at the night sky, and then back at Ryan. “Nothing.”
“Thom likes everybody, Bret,” Ryan said quietly. “Thom would become
friends with a head of lettuce if he could. A taco. A raccoon.” I smiled at
Ryan, letting him know that I knew this too about Thom. And yet I couldn’t
let it go.
“Yeah, but I think there’s something wrong with him,” I murmured.
Ryan was losing the thread of the conversation. He asked, somewhat
confused, “Who? Thom?”
“No. Robert,” I said. “I think there’s something wrong with him.”
He looked at me, concerned. “Like what?” He floated off the bench he’d
been sitting on and started to step through the water toward me. I realized I
couldn’t tell him what I knew—about the developmental center in
Jacksonville that Robert had been a patient at—because of the promise I’d
made to Susan, the secret I told her I’d keep. In the silence that ensued I
drifted off.
“I’d do him,” Ryan said, nearing me. The light in the Jacuzzi was off but
the adjacent pool was glowing aqua blue and illuminated his features, and
with his hair slicked back the details of his almost perfectly symmetrical face
were more pronounced and I even noticed for the first time that a very light
span of freckles dotted his nose and cheekbones. I hated that he said this
about Robert but I was so relaxed and so dazed by the sex that a kind of
calmness mitigated the flair of emotion I suddenly experienced when Ryan
said that. And I had to agree with him about Robert Mallory. “Yeah, me too,”
I said. “I’d do him too.” Ryan was directly in front of me, on his knees,
staring into my eyes as I felt a hand on my dick, and then he said in a low
voice, heavy with lust, “What would you do to him?” He was so close to me
our lips touched and I could feel the tip of his erection as it pressed against
my thigh.
“Tell me,” he said. “What would you do to him first?”
—
THERE WAS A MOMENT NEAR the end of the weekend when things
slightly veered off course and this was early Sunday night. Ryan had been
watching football games all afternoon in the living room and drinking
Coronas since around two o’clock and I kept wandering in and out, working
on my book in the bedroom, going over an essay I was late with, joining him
for an occasional pool break—we’d already had sex when we woke up—and
at one point Debbie called, wanting to know how I was feeling and if she
needed to come over: maybe she could bring me something, chili from
Chasen’s, Double Rainbow ice cream—and I spoke to her in the kitchen,
mid-morning, in front of Ryan, who was eating a bagel with smoked salmon
while reading the “Sports” section of the Sunday L.A. Times and said nothing
when I had to reply, “Love you, too,” and then hung the phone up. Ryan
simply accepted that Debbie Schaffer was something that I was going to
pursue and took another bite of the bagel and turned a page, but not before
glancing at me with a grin and an exaggeratedly cocked eyebrow. I shrugged.
“It’s okay,” he said. “I get it.” But when Debbie called again, later, on the
main line after I hadn’t picked up the phone in my bedroom, while we were
in the living room, and I didn’t pick up, she left a long message on the
answering machine and I watched as Ryan seemed jolted with tension,
slightly writhing, raising the volume on the TV, holding the remote with his
arm pointing straight at the screen, trying to drown out Debbie, and he shook
his head when she finally hung up but didn’t say anything. When she called a
third time, around six, Ryan was still slumped in the armchair in front of the
TV, a number of empty Corona bottles on the floor next to him, and he
howled: “Jesus Christ—what does she fucking want?” He craned his neck to
see where I was. “What is she expecting from you?”
I was in the kitchen looking to put out something for dinner. “She just
wants to know how I am,” I said, shrugging.
“Your imaginary illness?” Ryan asked, rolling his eyes. “She just wants
to know if you’re recovering from your imaginary illness?” He made a noise.
“Smart girl. Can’t she take a hint?”
“She doesn’t know it’s not real,” I muttered, pulling a bowl covered with
Saran Wrap out of the refrigerator, inspecting it—penne with mozzarella and
tomatoes, Rosa’s bland specialty.
“She’s a spoiled fucking mess,” Ryan said, quietly staring at the TV:
halftime somewhere was starting, a commercial appeared.
“She’s not a mess,” I said, finally moving toward him and standing by
the armchair. “She really isn’t. She just cares…about me.”
“They’re all spoiled fucking rotten,” Ryan said quietly, and then, lightly
exasperated, “Jesus, Bret, come on.”
This was the first time there was any tension, an opposition to what we’d
shared during those days, and I suppose I could have let it go and moved
back into the kitchen and continued pulling the premade dishes Rosa had left
for that weekend, but instead I just stood there and finally asked, “Who is
they?”
He paused, made a face, turned to look up at me. “Really?”
“Yeah,” I said. “Who is they?”
He looked back to the television. “Well, Debbie Schaffer, your
girlfriend, for one, with her fucking horse and her beyond-entitled attitude.
Tony Matthews, Jeff Taylor—”
“What are you doing?” I asked.
“—Dominic Thompson traipsing around fucking Europe all summer,
Tracy Goldman—”
“What about Thom?” I interrupted him.
A pause. “Of course he is,” Ryan said quietly. “He’s probably the
worst.”
“The worst what?” I asked, and then, “How can you say that about
Thom?”
Ryan waved a hand at me. I realized he was drunk. “They’re all spoiled
and they do whatever they want and there are no consequences for any of
them—”
“Consequences about what?” I asked, straining.
“Being a disgusting rich kid,” he said, staring at the TV, using the remote
to move across channels. “Kyle Colson. Susan Reynolds. Doug Furth.
Clueless. That fucking new kid, Robert, with his fucking Porsche 911. Who
gets their kid a Porsche 911?”
“What about Matt Kellner?” I ventured.
Ryan just shrugged at the name, didn’t say anything.
“You’re hardly poor, Ryan,” I said finally. “You certainly pass pretty
easily.”
“Thanks a lot,” he muttered.
“You can’t possibly care about this,” I said. “Come on, you’re joking.
You don’t really care.” And then, “I thought you liked Thom.”
“I like Thom Wright,” Ryan said patiently. “But Thom Wright is also a
wuss. A wussy little rich kid who doesn’t have a clue.”
“Thom Wright thinks you’re one of his best friends.”
I had been staring at the TV and when I looked down at him from where
I was standing I could see that his face was tensed with spite. “Thom Wright
is clueless. He doesn’t know anything about anything except his stupid little
world—”
“I think Thom knows more than that,” I said. “I think Thom knows about
pain.”
“How? Everything is given to him. How do any of our so-called
classmates, Bret, know about pain when everything is given to them?” He
paused. “They’re all spoiled fucking robots, protected in their mansions and
given everything they want.”
“Thom’s parents divorced—”
“Oh yeah, Daddy had to move to New York and get a better job to keep
little Tommy and his mom all gussied up in Beverly Hills—”
“Thom is a nice guy, Ryan, and he’s a friend of ours.”
“I didn’t say he wasn’t a nice guy.” He suddenly sat up—alarmed that
this was my takeaway. “I said he was a disgusting little rich kid. But I didn’t
say he wasn’t a nice guy.”
“You’re drunk,” I said. “You sound crazy.”
“Maybe,” he said, shrugging. “Maybe I’m totally crazy.”
“Why do you have so much contempt for Thom? Or for Susan?” I
stopped, and then asked, “What about me?”
He shrugged again. “You all just protect each other.”
“Protect each other?” I asked. “From what?”
“Reality.” Ryan said this in a purposefully spooky voice, making it echo
away from him, as if he spoke it in a vast and empty cave.
—
I DIDN’T PUSH IT further because there didn’t seem to be any point—Ryan
was mildly drunk and something about the message that Debbie Schaffer had
left annoyed him, which led to this quiet tirade about our classmates—that
was all. Ryan may have lived in Northridge, which admittedly wasn’t as
desirable as Beverly Hills, and his father might not have been a famous
movie producer or a studio executive or a wealthy real-estate developer and,
unlike just about all of his classmates, Ryan usually held down a summer job,
but I always thought of him as one of us, and he had something very few
students at Buckley possessed, in fact only two or three, and that was a
pronounced physical beauty—whatever else eluded Ryan that he may have
longed for this one tangible and hard fact about him remained: he was
beautiful. And I doubt Ryan would have traded that for Debbie Schaffer’s
mansion in Bel Air or Dominic Thompson’s yacht or Robert Mallory’s
Porsche. I just blamed this weird petulance on five or six Coronas, since I’d
never seen Ryan drink alcohol before and I believed that this was what stoked
his quiet outrage, and I let it go. I had never really heard a hint of this classconsciousness in any of the conversations that we’d had last spring or over
the summer. But maybe, I thought, he actually had shared this with me at one
point and I just hadn’t noticed, too lost in his beauty to fully hear him and
grasp who Ryan really was besides just a body, a form, an erotic trophy I
wanted to win.
Before another football game started Ryan stumbled up and collected the
empty beer bottles on the floor next to the armchair and carefully walked into
the kitchen and after placing the bottles by the sink pressed against me where
I was standing by the island and wrapped his arms around my chest, lightly
grinding against my ass. He murmured an apology as his lips grazed my ear
and then he turned me around and dropped to his knees—this was the sixth
time we’d had sex that weekend, and the last, it turned out. We fell asleep
together but he knew that the housekeeper was going to be here at eight the
next morning and made me set the alarm. When it went off at seven-thirty, I
bolted awake and turned over, but he was already gone. The empty side of
the bed was the first hint that maybe Ryan Vaughn wouldn’t be taking this as
seriously as I was—he hadn’t woken me when he’d left, he hadn’t said
goodbye, he hadn’t kissed me. The second hint was the flash of sadness and

KATHERINE LATCHFORD WAS FOUND in a dumpster in the back of a
gas station near Redlands that hadn’t been emptied for a month, and Sarah
Johnson’s body had been stuffed in a drainpipe at an abandoned construction
site on the outskirts of Simi Valley, but Julie Selwyn’s remains were
“presented” in a much more public place when they were finally found—
discovered on a tennis court at the Shadow Ranch Park in Woodland Hills by
two high-school guys who went to Taft and wanted to play a few sets early
that morning—and this suggested that the Trawler was getting increasingly
comfortable with the story he was creating, and that perhaps he wanted to
make a more immediate impression. The boys from Taft thought that what
they were approaching on the green asphalt was a mannequin, someone’s
idea of a perverse joke, until they smelled a faint rancidness and noticed the
clouds of gnats swarming over the desiccated body propped up against the
net, legs splayed: there was the skull with the full head of hair and the empty
sockets where the eyes had been gouged out and newspapers had been
stapled to her body, acting as a kind of wrapping paper, concealing the
mutilations—what were later called the “alterations” and the “remakings”—
inflicted upon Julie Selwyn. These “alterations” were not known until a series
of articles about the Trawler was published in the Los Angeles Times later
that year, filling in gaps and answering questions people kept wondering
about, though it didn’t go into a full and complete description and remained
somewhat vague because the details about the “alterations” and the
“remakings” and the “assemblages” were too obscene and upsetting for what
was deemed a family newspaper.
—
THE WEEK JULIE Selwyn’s body was found the LAPD confirmed they had
received two phone calls from the suspect or suspects (“the groaning drawl”
of the suspect’s “fake” voice, the voice that promised it had committed the
crimes, and would commit more, was confirmed in the articles that followed)
and the nickname that was connected to the suspect was—twice cited as a
joke in the redacted file from the Hollywood division of the LAPD—the
Trawler. Later, in the L.A. Times, there was a photo of a letter scrawled in
childlike handwriting from the suspect, the obscenities deleted in black,
admitting that he “and his friends” had abducted Julie Selwyn when she was
walking to her car, leaving a party on a hillside street in Encino—not far from
Haskell Avenue, I noted. What wasn’t shown was the letter detailing the
damage the Trawler had done to her, something only he would have known—
confirming his guilt—and what the two boys from Taft hadn’t been able to
see beneath the newspapers stapled to what was left of the girl’s body. The
only thing leaked—and this was never verified that first year—sounded so
outlandish as to have been made up, an urban myth, something akin to the
quarts of semen that were supposedly pumped out of Rod Stewart’s stomach,
but even more ghastly: the fish from Katherine Latchford’s aquarium,
missing a week before she was abducted (and after a poster for the Madness
record One Step Beyond was left at the doorstep of her parents’ house off
Coldwater Canyon in Studio City), had been inserted into Katherine’s vagina
which was glued shut with a liberal amount of rubber cement.
The questions that week in September had become numerous: Where
were the bodies kept during those eight weeks between abduction and
discovery? How had they been preserved to the degree that they were? When
were the girls actually killed? What was the actual cause of death? The Los
Angeles Times also confirmed that the home invasions that began plaguing
the city during the summer of 1980 and the early winter of 1981 and resumed
in the late spring of that year and then stopped and began again in the second
week of September were definitely connected to the murders, since it was
confirmed all three victims in the weeks leading up to their disappearance had
complained of the silent phone calls, the rearranged furniture in their
bedrooms, the mysterious gifts left for them—in Sarah Johnson’s case a
poster for the Public Image Ltd double-LP Second Edition and in Julie
Selwyn’s a promotional poster for the Cure record Three Imaginary Boys
—and, most ominously, the number of disappeared pets from the surrounding
neighborhoods that were later sacrificed. But it was also noted that none of
the three girls, the murder victims, had been previously attacked by whoever
was committing the home invasions.
—
I BECAME MILDLY FREAKED out that week even though there was an
element about the announcement of the Trawler—a confirmation of evil—
that made everything vibrate softly with melodrama and I almost became
excited in the atmosphere that was playing out: heightened, lightly
dangerous, somewhat sexualized. There was an initial narrative that I was
creating against the backdrop of these sickening crimes that felt like being in
a movie, especially when I’d play Fleetwood Mac’s “I’m So Afraid” in the
empty house on Mulholland high on Valium, wandering along the veranda,
imagining someone was watching me, accompanied by Lindsey
Buckingham’s wailing guitar solo echoing over the cliff side and the
eucalyptus and jacaranda trees, but it couldn’t sustain itself and soon I was
buying weed from Jeff Taylor in order to fall asleep more easily, numbing
myself from the fear that would descend in the moments after I got into bed
and turned off the lights, imagining sounds everywhere, the Trawler breaking
in, because it was your turn now, the ski mask above me would say in that
awful drawling voice, eyes wide with madness.
And then I was both surprised and disturbed that the discovery of Julie
Selwyn and her connection to the two other murdered girls wasn’t much
talked about or given the weight that I thought it deserved at Buckley. It
seemed to me that people weren’t paying attention; maybe people knew that
Julie Selwyn had been found and maybe there were others who’d heard about
the connections between her and Katherine Latchford and Sarah Johnson but
Susan and Debbie weren’t as interested as I was and this disappointed me.
When I’d ask them about what I called “the case” or what they thought about
the Trawler, at first they didn’t know what I was talking about, both of them
preoccupied, and they deflected my interest by moving on to the planning of
Susan’s party or a band Debbie wanted to check out downtown or the
mysterious Robert Mallory (but only if Thom wasn’t around, I’d noticed),
and both of them wondering if I’d fully recovered from the weekend when
I’d told Debbie I wasn’t feeling well enough to hang out with her—days I
had spent mostly naked with Ryan Vaughn. I deflected their deflections.
—
DEBBIE AND SUSAN AND I were sitting beneath the Pavilion during
lunch—Thom was at another table, crowded with members of the Griffins,
including Ryan, and I hated that Ryan wasn’t glancing over here just a table
away, at least halfway acknowledging me, and Debbie was busy
concentrating on a late assignment, her pen quickly scanning across a sheet of
college-ruled paper while she checked the open textbook in front of her, and
Susan was turning pages in a recent Rolling Stone with Jim Morrison on the
cover (“He’s hot, he’s sexy and he’s dead” was the headline) and even
though he’d died over a decade ago, the Doors had been rediscovered by us
and we all owned their Greatest Hits and the soundtrack that summer and fall
was dotted with “Light My Fire” and “Break On Through” and “L.A.
Woman.” I remember that day I noticed Robert Mallory in the distance,
walking into the courtyard plaza, my eyes trailing him until he stood over
Matt Kellner, who was wearing a Walkman, sunning himself as usual, and
simply nodded at Robert, who sat down, rummaging through a white-andblack-checked lunch bag and brought out a sandwich. Matt, looking pale,
almost gaunt, just leaned back against the wall and slipped on his Ray-Bans,
which suggested without saying anything: I don’t want to be bothered. In
retrospect, once certain details about what preceded the murders had been
publicized it occurred to me—too late—that Matt’s aquarium had been
tampered with and his furniture moved and his cat had disappeared but I was
trying so hard to stop thinking about Matt Kellner that I simply didn’t put it
together at first, mostly because the Trawler had only killed women and Matt
didn’t fit that profile and I was too lingeringly obsessed with Ryan Vaughn,
who had erased Matt, as well as Robert Mallory, who was eclipsing
everything else.
I was perusing that morning’s issue of the Los Angeles Times and
mentioned again Julie Selwyn and this thing that suddenly appeared who was
taking responsibility for the home invasions and the missing pets, besides the
three murders, and the girls just didn’t react in the ways I’d expected. Yeah,
they both murmured, looking over at the photos in the paper—“She was a
pretty girl,” Susan said, both of them confirming that they knew who Julie
Selwyn was—and yet Debbie went back to her homework and Susan’s eyes
darted to the article about Jim Morrison in Rolling Stone, something else
more interesting occupying her mind in that moment. When I mentioned the
Trawler again they didn’t know what I was talking about—they knew a body
had been found on the tennis court at the Shadow Ranch Park but they didn’t
go further into the story, or acknowledge that whoever had killed Julie
Selwyn had also committed two other murders. I felt as if I was floating
above everybody, alone, the only one of us who cared about these crimes, as
my eyes kept being drawn to Robert Mallory innocently sitting beneath a
walnut tree on a warm September afternoon, concentrating on his lunch, Matt
Kellner beside him. And I wondered why Robert hadn’t joined us, why he
wasn’t sitting with Debbie and Susan and myself at the center table beneath
the Pavilion. It was as if there was a presence that he didn’t want to disturb
and I thought: it was Susan. I almost called him over—Matt wouldn’t have
cared—but realized that I didn’t want him sitting with us, because there was
something wrong with him and I had a terrible premonition that Susan
Reynolds was falling in love. I looked back at the article in the Los Angeles
Times, frustrated that no one but me seemed to care.
But maybe in Southern California we were burned out by the number of
serial killers roaming the landscape throughout the seventies and into the
eighties, crisscrossing each other on the freeways and through the canyons
and boulevards, hunting for victims hitchhiking at the beaches and waiting at
bus stops, hanging out at gas-station diners up the coast and stumbling drunk
out of bars, from Glendale to Oceanside, Westminster to Redding, Cathedral
City to Long Beach, strewing mutilated corpses, extravagantly tortured with
steel pipes and broken glass, in dumps and sand dunes and forests and along
Highway 395—a time before video surveillance and cellphones and DNA
profiling, when serial killers were allowed to be cavalier and bountiful: the
number of murders committed by just one or a duo could hit twenty or thirty,
fifty or sixty, during that particular decade. (Mass shooters have replaced
them.) Maybe the Trawler didn’t seem threatening enough with only three
confirmed kills and maybe everyone around me just felt so young and
invincible and that’s why the initial news of the Trawler’s victims failed to
ignite the conversation that I thought it deserved. But it really didn’t interest
anyone yet, not even after the press conferences, or that weekend when new
ghoulish details emerged in a long piece in the Los Angeles Times. Susan
kept busily planning the party at the house in Beverly Hills on North Canon
Drive that, as only Susan and Debbie and Thom and I knew, was really being
thrown for Robert Mallory. To maintain a kind of frazzled innocence I did
whatever Debbie wanted that week and accompanied her to wherever she
went, because this calmed me—at Buckley she was all over me, ruffling my
hair into place and straightening my tie and leaning in to lightly kiss my lips
at the mid-morning assembly, where she had the largest audience watching
us, and always holding my hand as we walked to class or up to lunch at the
tables below the Pavilion, where we’d sit with Susan and Thom, and
occasionally joined by others, usually members of the football team, while I
became even more acutely aware that no one talked about the Trawler.
—
THAT WEEK I could feel something had changed between myself and Ryan
—we had created a hard-core history in just two days when there was nothing
about each other we hadn’t felt or seen or tasted but he seemed shyer and less
emboldened than I thought he’d become. I never assumed Ryan was going to
metamorphose into a brash, uncaring punk because of what we’d experienced
—the breakthrough—but I was surprised at how subdued and evasive he
became on campus, as if he was paranoid someone was watching us, studying
our interactions, finding clues in the ways we looked at each other, and the
usual knowing glance in the hallway by our lockers or beneath the bell tower
became a fixed smile that turned into blankness—there seemed to be a new
anxiety about even looking at me because this would give something away to
whoever was watching us, our secret stalker, or maybe Ryan was being, in
his words, “practical” and “pragmatic” and making sure the movie we were
in streamed forward smoothly and that his evasion was simply for Debbie’s
benefit and therefore mine, and on that level I should have been grateful. And
yet that week he eagerly came over to the house on Mulholland after school
and even with Rosa preparing my dinner in the kitchen or folding towels in
the pantry he felt no trepidation to walk with me to my bedroom, where we
locked the door, shut the thin gray venetian blinds, stripped fully naked and
then fucked quickly with both of us coming within minutes, my mouth
pressed against his, muffling the sounds he made while his body strained at
orgasm.
The sex that occurred that week replaced us hanging together during
lunch and Ryan never joined me anymore, preferring to sit with Dominic and
Doug and Kyle while I sat with Thom and Susan and Debbie and sometimes
Jeff Taylor and Tracy Goldman, and Jeff would watch Thom and me play
backgammon while the girls planned Susan’s party with Tracy. There were
always new details, new setbacks, endless tiny dramas about nothing—they
had decided on inviting the junior class as well, they were going to order
sushi, they were adding songs to the mixtape. No one mentioned the dead
girls. When we were standing at our lockers I asked Ryan what he thought
about the discovery of Julie Selwyn and the announcement of the Trawler
and he looked at me blankly and muttered that he didn’t know what that was.
Our eyes caught after he answered and in that moment lust flashed in the
space between us and he breathed in and just nodded and I did the same,
almost involuntarily. He muttered, “I want to come over again,” and as I
placed two textbooks into the locker I muttered back, “Yeah, I want to taste
your cock,” and he was briefly jolted, then quietly asked, “Yeah, you want
me to fuck you again?” and I couldn’t speak, just nodded, busying myself
with something in my locker. And then he drifted away to another class
without saying anything else. My face always reddened and I always had to
control my breathing.
—
THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING HAPPENING, I noticed, to Susan
Reynolds during that week in the fall of 1981. Another kind of beauty began
to announce itself; something was glowing within her, it seemed, a new
radiance, and I couldn’t pinpoint exactly where it was emanating from: she
just seemed more beautiful as she passed through seventeen; there was an
effortless confidence about her movements that was riveting. She wasn’t
reactive or surprised or disturbed by things—she was just gliding calmly
through our world vaguely stoned and this gave her an even more
pronounced sexual aura. She had done something to her hair and I couldn’t
tell what and I hadn’t asked but it was slightly shorter, and the makeup she
wore might have been more pronounced—around the eyes, her lips—but still
subtle. She almost never wore the Buckley blazer—most girls and a lot of the
guys didn’t once classes began because it was too warm to wear year-round
and instead kept them hung in their lockers—but it was actually required of
everybody during the mid-morning assembly, where the Pledge of Allegiance
and the school prayer were intoned, and that’s where I noticed that Susan,
even below the Buckley blazer, was wearing a new variation of the white
blouse that was part of the girls’ uniform, and that Susan’s was gauzier and
more stylish than her classmates’; now, with two or three buttons left open
(unlike just the top one), you could clearly see the cleavage of her breasts,
which I realized she wanted us to. But this wasn’t for Thom Wright’s benefit:
this was something Susan was doing, I realized fearfully, for someone else,
and though it wasn’t proven yet, I sensed it was for Robert Mallory, as was
the higher hem of the gray skirt, which she was now wearing upper-thigh,
like Debbie Schaffer.
When this hit me, on the Wednesday after the weekend I spent with
Ryan—I was talking to Susan beneath the bell tower in front of the library—I
momentarily zoned out and missed whatever she’d been saying to me, staring
at the tops of her breasts, and then forced myself to pay attention, and nod
thoughtfully, agreeing with whatever she had just proposed. But she stopped,
looked at me quizzically and asked, “Really? What did I just say?” I didn’t
want her to know that I’d lost the conversation at least a minute ago but when
I made eye contact and looked at her blankly she just sighed.
“Oh, Bret,” she said. “What are we going to do with you?”
“What are we going to do with me?” I asked, shrugging. “You have any
ideas?”
“You okay?” she asked. “What happened to you?”
“It was just a flu,” I said. “A bug. It was nothing.”
“You disappeared,” Susan said.
“I was in my bedroom the whole time—”
“Why didn’t you want Debbie to come over?” Susan asked. “Bring you
stuff, take care of you?”
A flash of annoyance woke me up, because Susan knew something she
wasn’t admitting—this inquiry felt like a tease, as if she sensed I was hiding
Ryan Vaughn. Mild anxiety lightly danced around my chest while I stared at
her and then I shook my head, shrugging, playing a part. “There was no
need,” I said. “She didn’t need to bother. I didn’t want her to waste her time.”
I then added, “I was fine.”
“I hardly think she would have seen it as a waste of time,” Susan said.
“Considering that you’re her boyfriend, right?”
I stared at her, wondering what she was doing. The “right?” punctuating
that sentence created a negative dimension, made it seem as if Susan knew I
really wasn’t Debbie’s boyfriend; it was a challenge. I thought about helping
her speed along to wherever she wanted to go with this conversation but
realized there were too many pitfalls and I didn’t want either one of us to trip
into them.
“Yeah, I just wasn’t feeling it,” I said casually, looking past her to the
parking lot. I spotted Robert’s black Porsche as if my eyes were inadvertently
drawn to it, darkly gleaming in the sun.
“Well, she was feeling it,” Susan said. “Coming to see you. I mean did
you consider that?” She paused. “How hard would it have been to let her
come over on Saturday or Sunday?”
I stayed silent and just stared at Susan. She was staring back at me with
blank green eyes, the lashes very lightly mascaraed, waiting for me to say
something, and I suddenly felt a hopelessness that could never be eradicated.
It seemed so vast there was no reason to even try. I breathed in, just staring at
her. And she kept her gaze fixed back on mine, patiently, waiting for an
answer. Where was the tangible participant, the willing boyfriend, I had
decided to become for the rest of the year? Where was the actor going along
with the pantomime? But I managed it effortlessly—I breathed in and
grinned, even though I now saw this conversation as some kind of
confrontation, and breezily said, “I didn’t want her to catch what I had so I
was, in fact, the caring boyfriend, Susan.”
“What were your symptoms?” Susan asked, concerned. “What was
wrong?”
“Why?” I said, flinching. “I had a headache. I was nauseous. I thought I
was coming down with something.” A long pause followed and it was filled
with so many things unspoken. How had we arrived at a point when what we
wanted to say to each other was now floating in the pauses that dominated the
conversation?
“Anyway, I’m glad you’re feeling better,” Susan said. “Thom and I were
worried when you weren’t picking up the phone over the weekend. I mean I
know Thom doesn’t really like to talk on the phone but you and I usually do.”
“Yeah, I know, but I got your messages, so…” I said and then left it at
that. I had nowhere else to go.
“Why didn’t you pick up?” she asked. “When I called? Or when Thom
called?”
“Susan,” I said. It came out as a warning, which is maybe what she
wanted.
“It was kind of a strange weekend,” she said. “Everyone seemed gone.”
“Yeah?” I asked. I started walking with her into the parking lot. “What
do you mean?”
“Well, Jeff had gone out to Malibu with Tracy, Robert was in Palm
Springs with his aunt and Thom couldn’t locate where Ryan was. Tony and
Kyle weren’t around either.” Susan paused as we neared her car. “Ryan’s dad
said that he was going to spend the weekend with a friend but he didn’t know
who it was. Do you have any idea?”
Robert was in Palm Springs with his aunt. Why would Susan know this?
Why would she place Robert in this list of our absent friends? Why would
she reveal this to me so casually? But she had asked me about Ryan and
where I thought he might have been and I had to answer her.
“Why don’t you ask Ryan?” I said. “Why would I know?”
“I thought you guys had become friends,” she said.
“Well, I certainly don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know where Ryan was.”
She paused and this silent beat meant she was processing what I had just
told her. A lie.
“Anyway, I’m glad you’re okay—”
“Susan—” I started, my eyes closed. “Just let’s drop it, okay?”
“Drop what?” she asked, seemingly innocent.
“I have my own life,” I said. “If I want to spend the weekend alone,
working on my book or just hanging out by myself, I really, really hope that’s
okay with you and I don’t have to answer to anyone as to why I want to be
alone.” I stopped, and then blurted out: “Maybe I wasn’t even sick! Maybe I
was feeling fucking fantastic and just wanted to be alone. Is that okay with
everyone? Or did I do something bad?” I jutted out my lower lip like a child
who’d been chastised and talked in a baby voice. “I was a bad boy, Susan?
Did I do something bad?”
“No.” I heard this in the same soft unwavering tone—if she was
perturbed it didn’t register. “Not at all, Bret.”
“Whatever I did this past weekend has nothing to do with Debbie,” I
said.
“Yeah, that’s pretty obvious,” she muttered, walking in front of me to the
white BMW.
“Hey, hey—” I said, reaching out to turn her around.
She pulled her shoulder away from my grasp and put her books on the
roof of the car before facing me.
I was about to say something when she reached up and pressed a finger
against my lips. This had been a dramatic gesture we often made to each
other indicating we didn’t need to hear what the other person was going to
say because we already knew the answer and it wouldn’t make a difference
anyway, or it meant that the other person should stop asking questions that
were never going to be answered. It always amused us and we both smiled at
our awareness of this, something lovers did in a bad movie.
“You don’t need to say anything,” she said in a hushed voice. “I’m fine,
Bret, with whatever you want to do. I was just curious but you don’t need to
say anything.”
Her cool finger pressed against my lips disarmed me totally and any
anxiety I was feeling or the anger that had formed around me lifted away in
seconds and I exhaled as she lowered her hand, removing the finger.
“I don’t have anything to say,” I finally said. “Maybe that makes me
guilty.”
“Do we have secrets?” she asked suddenly. “We never used to, or so I
thought, maybe one or two. But do we have secrets now?”
Your secret is safe with me, I remember Susan told me this in Westwood
last spring and I never asked her what she meant. And then I automatically
thought of Robert Mallory and Susan’s supposed feelings for him—
something I had, admittedly, only heard about from Debbie Schaffer and no
one else. There was nothing to base it on except for what Debbie told me
when she was floating in the Jacuzzi two weekends ago when she hinted to
me that Susan liked him. And though it was embarrassing that Robert had
told Susan and Thom I’d been following him along Ventura Boulevard on the
afternoon of the first day of school, I actually never saw Susan and Robert
together those initial weeks in September, so there was no proof that this was
in fact a real thing. Sometimes I had to calm myself whenever I thought I was
creating this narrative in my head and the light paranoia Robert Mallory
conspired to swirl around me. You hear things that aren’t really there…This
was what a writer did.
“Why are you throwing a party for Robert Mallory?” I asked in a small
voice.
“Oh, stop it,” she muttered. “Really?”
“Is that part of a secret, Susan?” I asked.
She opened the driver’s-side door and slid into the BMW and again I
noticed how short her skirt had become before she closed it and I fell back
into that anxious state tied to her supposed feelings about Robert, which, for
me, were totally confirmed by the party she was so meticulously planning for
him. And then she looked at me after she unrolled the window and simply
said as she started the car, “It’s only one more year, Bret.” I just stared at her
blankly. “We’re only here for one more year,” she said.
—
AND A WEEK LATER ON the following Wednesday I ended up talking to
Robert Mallory—he approached me, otherwise this wouldn’t have happened,
meaning I would’ve never started a conversation with him willingly. It was
the first time we spoke since I saw him at the space on Melrose, where he
casually told me what he wanted to do with Susan Reynolds—lick her pussy,
fuck her ass, make her scream. This took place during Phys Ed, which was
third period that year for the senior class, in the hour before lunch, and it was
the only class of the day the entire twelfth grade shared, but with the boys
and girls usually separated. On that day the guys from the senior class were
on Gilley Field, while the girls were in the Pavilion, either swimming or
playing volleyball or maybe listening to records and just hanging out. Phys
Ed senior year was casual and participation only irregularly enforced
compared to the lower grades, when it was a more structured class and
participation was mandatory. Seniors were left alone to do whatever they
wanted—you could work out with weights, you could play tennis, if a group
of guys wanted to put together a soccer scrimmage or a touch-football game
then whoever wanted to join could do so, and some of the guys just sunned
themselves in the massive stand of bleachers that rose above the giant
rectangular grass field bordered by an oval track and beyond the track was a
baseball diamond complete with two dugouts, the San Fernando Valley,
smog-baked and endless, spread out below us. Coach Holtz or Coach
McCabe—both resolutely heterosexual though that didn’t stop me from
fantasizing about them—usually monitored everything from the sidelines,
hanging out beneath the goalposts that towered above the soccer nets at the
ends of the green field, whistles around their necks, holding clipboards, a few
guys conversing with them about the NFL games that aired over the week.
Above us forested hillsides surrounded the field leading all the way up to
Mulholland, and the only movements were cars silently driving along
Beverly Glen, which curved through the landscape overlooking the school.
On that particular day when I talked to Robert Mallory I was situated
near the top of the stands after running a few laps, my shirt off, lying on one
of the tiered rows of benches—there were exactly forty of them rising toward
the announcer’s booth—and I was mostly distracted by Ryan Vaughn
wearing a Griffin T ripped into a half-shirt and tossing a football to Thom in
red Griffin shorts, shirtless. Doug Furth and Kyle Colson were lazily jogging
along the track and Anthony Matthews was goofing off with Kevin Kerslake;
for some reason they were ducking each other on the baseball diamond,
where the American flag hung from a tall silver pole. Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers played from a boom box next to one of the goal posts and
“Here Comes My Girl” sounded echoey and faraway from where I sat,
marveling at Thom Wright’s athleticism as he leapt and threw a football with
balletic grace to Ryan, who ran backward, caught it, and then threw it back at
Thom, who captured it while still in motion. Earlier that day Ryan had
mentioned coming by after school and my body tightened with lust when I
thought about him naked in my bedroom and I watched intently as he placed
his hands on his knees, panting, and then looked around the field until his
eyes reached the top of the bleachers, where he spotted me and turned
abruptly away when someone called his name—no smile, no wave, the new
distance he imposed upon us in public clearly obvious to me, and I felt a soft
pang mixed with arousal along with images of his stiff pink penis, wet with
my saliva and jutting upward. I realized I hadn’t seen Matt Kellner that day
and I hadn’t noticed him at assembly—I glanced over at the tennis courts,
then back to the baseball diamond, then over to the coach’s office,
confirming that he definitely wasn’t there. “Tusk” was now playing from the
boom box and it made me think of Terry Schaffer and his resemblance to
Lindsey Buckingham and I smiled to myself as I watched Dominic
Thompson mock-marching to the song with Jon Yates and David O’Shea,
wondering when Terry or Steven Reinhardt was going to call me to set up a
meeting about the screenplay that Terry wanted me to write, and I shivered
with anticipation.
—
WHEN I REFOCUSED after rereading a few pages from Slouching Towards
Bethlehem, I saw Robert Mallory conferring with Thom and Ryan, the three
of them standing in the middle of the field, hands on their hips, occasionally
nodding to one another, Thom always smiling widely, beaming, so innocent,
so beautiful, and Ryan just staring at Robert, and I remembered the things he
whispered that he wanted to do to him in the Jacuzzi on that Sunday night,
his erection pressing against mine as we shared our sexual fantasies about the
new boy. I tensed up when I realized Robert was walking away from Ryan
and Thom and crossing the field, heading toward the stands. And then Robert
was confidently heading toward me and up the steps, his red shorts
provocatively hiked up, accentuating his bulge, and he was squinting as if he
couldn’t see me while he climbed the bleachers, swinging his arms
uncaringly. Coming from the distant boom box Pete Townshend was now
singing “Let My Love Open the Door” and because of where I was at
seventeen I realized I hadn’t seen Robert naked yet in the locker room and I
badly wanted to despite the mild revulsion he inspired but his locker was on
the other side of the divide and this was the reason. He just nodded as he
stood on the bench below mine, looking out to where the Valley came up
against the San Gabriel Mountains, and he stretched, taking the view in. I
could smell him—that particular scent of sandalwood and cedar and ash
wafted over me and acted as a narcotic. The Griffin T was tight and promoted
his tan biceps and I could make out the rippled abs and pectorals beneath it
and my eyes casually traced the muscled thighs very lightly lined with brown
hair and I averted my gaze when I caught the whiteness of his underwear
beneath the red shorts as he sat down.
“Nice up here,” he said. “Quiet. No one around.”
He paused, scanning the field and the small figures scattered about on the
vast green lawn. I played it cool and didn’t say anything. I felt self-conscious
in his presence and was going to put my T-shirt back on but worried this
would start a conversation that I didn’t want to have—you don’t have to be
shy around me, Bret. My nipples stiffened as if a cool breeze had suddenly
drifted over the stands and I put down the Joan Didion paperback and was
now leaning forward as if concealing something. Robert always managed to
put me in an apprehensive mood.
“What are you doing up here?” he asked innocently. “All alone?”
“Plotting my next move,” I said flatly.
At first he seemed shocked that I said this and then looked briefly
confused, as if I’d insulted him. I never wanted Robert to think anything
negative about me or that I’d purposefully avoided him. I actually wanted
him to be calm and realized I’d been careless with that particular greeting and
yet I was surprised he assumed it was connected to him. Plotting my next
move. For me: sometimes Robert was around, sometimes Robert wasn’t and
that was fine. I hadn’t gotten up and left the lunch table when he sat down
and I never looked away when we made eye contact passing each other at the
lockers or on the walkways under the eaves, and we always managed a smile.
He was in two of my classes (Senior English, European History) even though
he sat in the front row and I sat in the back in both, and we never
acknowledged each other there. The only times he truly alarmed me at
Buckley were when I saw him talking with Matt Kellner at the mid-morning
assembly or eating lunch with him in the courtyard below the Pavilion.
Otherwise I just tried to pretend that the Robert Mallory who lied to me about
being at the Village Theater a year ago, and the Robert Mallory that
desecrated the statue, and the Robert Mallory who had spoken obscenely
about Susan Reynolds, simply didn’t exist. He was just part of the overall
erasure that I was enacting: the eradication of my real self into the tangible
participant who saw everything as normal. The fact that he was sitting in
front of me and it was just the two of us at the top of the bleachers
overlooking Gilley Field and I hadn’t walked away was, I hoped, proof that I
accepted him.
—
“I’M JUST HANGING,” I said, sitting up, correcting myself. “I ran a couple
laps.” And then: “I’m not plotting anything.”
“I was wondering where you’ve been hiding,” he said, stretching his legs
out.
“I haven’t been hiding,” I said, meeting his gaze. My answer came out as
a challenge and I hated that Robert always seemed to make me react this way.
“Why would you say that I’ve been hiding?”
“Maybe you’ve been avoiding me,” he said.
“Why would I be avoiding you?” I asked.
“I don’t know,” he said, leaning back. “Maybe I said some things you
didn’t like.”
I paused. “Like what?”
“Maybe I said something the other night at the space,” he said,
stretching. “That space on Melrose.”
I decided to be honest. “Oh, that?” I asked, without being specific. “I
guess I’m not used to people talking about my friends that way.”
“What way?” he asked, with a genuine curiosity.
“Things you said about Susan,” I muttered, gesturing. “All that sex
crap.”
“Dude. Really? You were offended?” He sat up and looked at me,
confused. “I’m sorry you’re so sensitive.” And then: “I’m just a guy.”
He smiled: dimples. In a movie I would have instantly desired him but in
the flesh his supposed innocence was overwhelmingly menacing because it
was so rehearsed and didn’t seem natural. This is what made everything tense
whenever he was around: I could see through the act and it was maddening
that no one else did. I was afraid of him—he scared me, and except for the
desecration of the Griffin, I didn’t know exactly why this fear existed. Maybe
because he had spent time in a developmental center outside of Jacksonville
his junior year and what chilled me: no one knew what the reasons were.
Maybe the reasons were innocent but maybe they weren’t. And yet we’d
promised Susan that none of us would bring the topic up and ask him about
it. We had to pretend we didn’t know in order to protect Robert Mallory: just
another absurdity in the fake world of Buckley life that the tangible
participant had to accept.
“And there’s other stuff,” I said, finally.
“Like what? Let’s hear it,” he said, amused, and then with slightly more
concern, “Wait. You’re not mad at me, are you?”
“Mad at you?” I asked. “No. Why would I be mad at you?”
“Well, you just walked away from me at the club—”
“I’m not mad.” I said this as gently as I possibly could.
“Well, what are you, then?” he asked, mimicking my gentleness.
“I’m not anything,” I said, raising my voice slightly, looking away from
him.
“Well, I think we should try and be friends,” he said coolly. “I mean,
don’t you?”
“Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. Everything’s fine,” I said. “Yeah, we should try
and be friends.” I paused. “I mean there’s no reason not to, right?”
“Good.” He nodded.
There was a pause. He seemed satisfied. He stretched again and lay back,
letting the sun wash over him, bleaching his head and body, and I could hear
Bruce Springsteen’s “Hungry Heart” playing from the field. I didn’t admit
this to Robert but I’d gotten pissed off and felt trapped in a totally fake
conversation—he had won a contest he put into play by coming to the top of
the stands and asking me why I’d been avoiding him even if I hadn’t. He
locked me into something I didn’t want to be a part of, starting a nonsensical
conversation that put me on the defensive. I sat very still while I looked down
at him, displayed like a teenage Greek god, and I couldn’t help thinking that
Robert knew he was taunting me, and in ways that were different from how
he was probably taunting Thom Wright and Matt Kellner. I resented the
paranoia he inspired and yet I also found him undeniably erotic, an
unparalleled object of teen boy desire and lust, and I hated the fact that these
two opposite feelings coexisted within me. I simply stared at him silently,
wondering what he looked like naked. He opened his eyes and stared back at
me, his head resting in the hands that were folded above his head, and said
nothing; he just kept staring at me with a half-smile. If it had been any other
boy I would have thought this was a come-on.
“Matt Kellner told me you were asking about me, asking, like,
questions,” I said.
“Oh yeah?” he said, just gazing at me. “Really?” he asked softly.
“Why don’t you just ask me?” I said, noticing my voice was slightly
tremulous. “Don’t talk to Matt, just talk to me.”
Robert continued to lie there in the sun, and a hand absentmindedly
reached under his T-shirt to scratch himself and I caught a glimpse of his
hard tan stomach, the abs and the trace of hair leading up from the shorts to
his navel, lightly pushed out, pronounced. His eyes were closed again and he
seemingly took what I said in stride.
“Really? Matt told you that? Like, what was I asking?”
“He didn’t say,” I said softly. “But what did you want? What did you
want to know about me?”
“I think Matt’s a little strange,” Robert said, eyes still closed. “If you ask
me.”
I paused, staring at him. “Strange is…relative.”
“What does that mean?” He was smiling when he asked this, but curious,
and yet his eyes were still closed.
“Well, people…probably think I’m a bit strange.” I paused, not knowing
where I was going with this. “And…people probably…think you’re strange.”
I paused again. “I don’t know. I mean, strange is…relative.”
He shrugged. I had lost him. “Yeah, I guess, but I think Matt has…
crossed a line.” He paused and then said, “Into. Utter. Weirdness.” His eyes
were still closed.
“You don’t know him, Robert.” I inadvertently said his name, wanting to
make a point. I immediately regretted it.
Robert opened his eyes and squinted at the sky before sitting back up.
“But you do, right?” He paused. “You do know Matt.”
I shrugged. I didn’t know what to say or how much to admit.
“You should talk to him,” Robert said. “See what’s wrong. I think he’s
depressed.” He paused. “I haven’t seen him. He’s been absent a couple days.”
“I think…he just smokes too much weed,” I said, carefully. “I’ve never
known Matt to be depressed exactly.”
“But, then, you don’t really know him, do you?” Robert said. “Right?”
Robert crossed his legs, and then moved his hand into his shorts and
adjusted his genitals so he’d be more comfortable in that position. “He said
you guys had a falling out,” Robert murmured. “If you guys had a falling out
you must’ve…known each other…” He trailed off suggestively. “Right?”
“What would we have had…a falling out about?” I stared at the hand that
had just touched his cock and balls and felt another quick flash of desire.
He shrugged. “You want to tell me?”
“I don’t know what he’s talking about,” I said quietly, and then, “Did he
really say that to you?” I paused. “Did he really tell you we had a falling
out?”
Robert looked at me without saying anything until, “I don’t know, Bret, I
just don’t know.” Robert said this shaking his head, his gaze fixed up at me.
“What…don’t you know?” I asked.
“If you’re being real with me,” he said softly.
“I feel no obligation to be real with you, Robert, whatever that means.” I
paused. “What were you asking Matt? About me?”
“I don’t really remember,” he said, staring. “Maybe I just wanted to get a
feel for everyone. It’s kind of hard being the new guy. Plus I don’t know if I
made the best first impression. With you.” He paused. “About the fact that
you thought you saw me somewhere that I wasn’t.”
“Forget it,” I murmured. “It doesn’t matter.” I felt completely unmoored
from everything in that moment.
“I’m just trying to be nice to you,” Robert said softly. “Even though…I
heard you have problems with me.”
This was a conversation one had in a dream, I thought. “Who did you
hear this from?” I managed in a mild, calm voice, but a light, glancing fear
started swirling. I wanted to end this conversation and yet his presence kept
me bolted to the bleachers.
“Well…” he began, hesitantly, “Matt said that you told him something
was wrong with me.” He said this grinning. “Would you like to tell me what
that is?”
I froze.
“Matt said that you told him he should probably stay away from me.”
Robert cocked his head, curious. “Really?”
I just sat on the bleacher above him, momentarily paralyzed until a
distant anger started reanimating me, bringing me closer into the reality of the
moment we were sharing.
“I also heard from Susan,” Robert was saying. “And from Thom.”
“Heard…what?” I asked, keeping calm, but my fists were clenched, my
nails biting into my palms.
“That I don’t tell the truth,” he said quietly. “That I’m a liar.”
A rage I’d never felt before flared and left me speechless. I stared at him,
hoping I looked uncaring, as if none of this bothered me in the slightest, that I
was too cool to give a shit about the pitiful mini-dramas and gossip of my
classmates, but I was legitimately enraged at Susan, at Thom, at myself, and I
felt ashamed sitting in front of Robert—they had talked about me to Robert,
they had told Robert that I mistrusted him. And maybe Robert could sense
this shame and anger, as much as I tried to hide it, because for the first time
since I’d met him something in Robert softened and he became vulnerable in
ways that took me back to the moment we’d first met him, below the
Pavilion, when he shuffled up to the table we were sitting at, clutching his
schedule and a rumpled map of the school, resembling a lost child.
“I mean, look, I don’t know,” he started gently. “I guess I probably need
to tell you things but…I can’t just yet,” he said. He left it there. It was my
turn.
“You don’t have to tell me anything,” I said, barely breathing, trying to
control myself.
“Okay, cool, that’s cool,” he said. And then there was a pause before he
asked, “But do you think I’m a liar because I said I wasn’t in that movie
theater?” He paused again. “The one you thought you saw me at?”
I snapped and stood up. “Look, Robert,” I said, wanting the conversation
to end. “I’m just…distracted this week. None of this really matters. I don’t
care about any of this bullshit. I’m just distracted by other things. Okay? It’s
not you.”
“What are you distracted by?” he asked. “By Matt?” He paused. “Do you
know where he is?”
“No, not by Matt,” I said. “Other things.” I gestured vaguely.
“About what?” he asked. And this was the gentlest I’d ever heard him:
he was concerned and seemed to care about what distracted me. Vulnerability
was emanating from him and it didn’t seem forced or rehearsed now—it was
genuine. There was a real person sitting on the bleachers waiting for me to
explain myself, my worries, my fears, wanting me to open up about Matt
Kellner and what I’d become so distracted by last week and this week, the
things that haunted me.
“About that girl who was found in Woodland Hills,” I said, suddenly
lost. “No one seems to care.”
There was a long silence while he processed this.
“But why should they?” he finally asked. “Did…people know her?”
“Do you know what I’m talking about?” I asked, barely noticing him,
transported into another world. “Julie Selwyn?”
“Are you asking me something?” he said. “I don’t understand.”
I froze again. The atmosphere got instantly complicated in that moment
and it was as if a new person suddenly possessed Robert and all the traces of
warmth and vulnerability that had manifested themselves only seconds before
were now gone and replaced by the three faces behind the whirring eyes.
There was the innocent face that was squinting up at me trying to figure Bret
out, and there was the face that was looking at everything else in a master
shot, wide-screened, where all the pieces were visible and in play and
offering a number of paths to navigate from this vantage point, and then there
was the increasingly hostile face of a dangerously ill psychopath who had
been institutionalized and was trying to contain himself and really didn’t care
about anything. This was the person who was suddenly staring up at me when
Coach Holtz blew his whistle, signaling it was time to hit the locker room and
get dressed for lunch.
“I was just asking if you know what I’m talking about.” I pulled on the
T-shirt and then leaned down to pick up the paperback. “That’s all.”
“Not really.” His voice was strained. “Do you want to tell me about it?”
His expression was slightly twisted with confusion.
And for a moment I wanted to tell him, but it passed and we were
interrupted by Thom and Ryan calling out across the field, waving for us to
come down from the top of the bleachers, and without saying anything
Robert simply followed me as I jogged the steps toward the edge of the dirt
track where the two of them were standing. And as we neared I made a
sudden run for Thom and tackled him, the two of us falling onto the grass
bordering the track—after that I didn’t know what else to do with my rage.
But when Ryan shouted out “Hey” and tried to pull me off Thom, he soon
realized that Thom was wrestling me, and that Thom had taken control, and
that Thom was laughing as he pinned me to the lawn—Thom thought I was
horsing around and that this was payback for him tackling me in the space on
Melrose the other night. When his sweaty armpit became pressed against my
face, covering my nose and mouth while Thom steadied me, coiled in an
embrace, his face just an inch from mine, so I could smell his milky breath,
that’s when I stopped struggling and tapped out and went limp. I could tell
from the look on Robert’s and Ryan’s faces that Thom had misread my move
—my rage reinterpreted as just clowning around. And a secret narrative
started playing itself out on Gilley Field in that moment as Thom and I
untangled ourselves, and this fake narrative about what really happened was
carried with us as we walked down the hill back to the locker room, where
three of us pretended that something else had happened instead of what really
did.
11
DURING LUNCH MY DESIRE to confront Susan and Thom about
confiding in Robert Mallory what I’d said about him was interrupted by the
faint, lightly gnawing apprehension I experienced whenever I noticed Matt
Kellner’s absence that week, which was confirmed when we were sitting at
the center table beneath the Pavilion. Susan walked over about fifteen
minutes into lunch after a private meeting with Dr. Croft and Headmaster
Walters just ended, looking confused in ways that were totally unlike the
blank-faced, utterly unworried girl she’d been enacting, and for the first time
that term seemed slightly perplexed when she told us that Matt Kellner was
missing—“officially missing” were the words she used, as if there was any
real difference. Simply “missing” sounded more ominous to me without the
“officially” attached to it.
I realized that this information supplied by Susan, through Dr. Croft and
Walters, verified that I really hadn’t seen Matt for the past few days and not
only that the red Datsun hadn’t been at its usual space in the senior parking
lot: this confirmed that the 280ZX wasn’t in the parking lot at all. I hadn’t
distractedly imagined any of this: the car definitely hadn’t been there, Matt
hadn’t been to Buckley in two days, he was now officially missing, and this
was going to be announced tomorrow at the mid-morning assembly. The
moment Susan said this as she sat down—Debbie, Thom, Ryan and Robert
were sitting at the table with us—I thought I was going to be sick. I dropped
the sandwich I’d been eating onto the paper bag and stared at it while trying
not to turn away from everyone; in fact I had to restrain myself from
stumbling up from the table and quietly collapsing in the boys’ restroom
located off the lobby in the Pavilion. But no one noticed that I’d dropped the
sandwich or that my body was suddenly rigid with tension. Everyone was
looking at Susan, wondering what this meant: Matt Kellner was missing?
Yeah…and? Even though I was automatically encased with dread when I
heard this, the fear I initially felt also seemed too dramatic at first, because no
one knew what happened yet—Matt might be playing hooky, lounging on a
beach somewhere up the coast, taking in the last rays of summer, high and
peaceful, crashing into waves and scoring weed. No one knew yet—it was a
mystery still tinged with hope.
—
I ALSO REALIZED I couldn’t appear too concerned or overly alarmed, or so
I felt, because that would open something up, it would give away a secret,
and if I broke down into a panic attack (because I was always assuming the
worst—I never thought Matt was going to be found alive) it would be the
beginning of a complicated narrative that might ultimately wreck everything
that had been put into play and that I was trying to save: maintaining
boyfriend status with Debbie, having secret sex with Ryan, getting through
senior year, carefully monitoring Robert Mallory from a neutral perspective. I
remember that in that initial moment after Susan told us Matt was missing I
looked over at Robert, who somehow intuited I was going to do this and
glanced back at me with a blank expression that lasted too long before
looking back at Susan, who was telling us what she’d been told by Croft. The
initial confusion creasing her features had reverted to that casual and sullen
beauty as she now simply recited the information to us, and yet I noticed that
Susan kept inadvertently glancing over at me, her eyes softly worried, while
talking about the few facts concerning Matt Kellner’s disappearance that she
knew, until I was glaring back at her, wishing she’d stop looking at me. And
then it seemed she forced herself to quit and, like an actress, addressed a table
that seemed relatively calm, even unconcerned, about the disappearance of
Matt Kellner.
—
WHEN IT WAS NOTED IN THE ATTENDANCE records that Matt hadn’t
been at Buckley for the past two days, Dr. Croft’s secretary called the Kellner
residence in Encino and wanted to know when Matt was coming back to
school, and Matt’s parents, Ronald and Sheila, neither of whom I’d ever seen,
let alone met, were unaware of Matt’s absence. And I knew why: Matt was
more autonomous than any of our classmates, the only one living by himself
in a pool house with its own garage in the back of the massive property on
Haskell Avenue. At this point in his adolescence Matt was rarely watched
over by his parents anymore—in fact I’d never heard Matt mention either one
of them and had no idea what his father did for a living. The reason that Ron
and Sheila Kellner didn’t know that Matt hadn’t been to school for two days
was precisely that he’d often be completely out of their sight, and sometimes
a week would pass without either of them glimpsing their son. What this
dynamic suggested was perhaps a more extreme example of what many of us
experienced as teenagers in the late 1970s and into the next decade, whereby
not engaging with your parents for days on end didn’t seem particularly
weird or abnormal—my parents, for example, were absent for more than two
months on a European cruise throughout the autumn of 1981, when I was
seventeen, and neither they nor I had any issues or trepidation about this
whatsoever.
One of the reasons Matt Kellner was given such particular leeway was
that his GPA was okay, his SAT scores were serviceable (and weren’t going
to get any better—he wasn’t going to retake them, unlike me in late October)
and he never got into trouble—Matt was just an avid purchaser of marijuana
who looked old enough to buy his own beer illegally and never got carded at
any of the liquor stores he frequented along Ventura Boulevard. In fact no
Buckley kid had ever gotten into any real trouble during those years and I
could count on one hand the number of physical altercations between the
boys in our class starting from seventh grade onward—I couldn’t even
remember the last time two guys in our class got into an actual argument; this
just didn’t happen at Buckley, the atmosphere was too controlling to allow it,
everything was too constrained. I may have been impressed that Matt never
got busted for buying—and smoking—as much weed as he did but, then,
everyone’s mild drug use was fairly under control in 1981 and there was no
such thing as rehab—at least for teenagers like Debbie Schaffer or Jeff Taylor
or Matt Kellner—it wasn’t ubiquitous yet. In fact I don’t think any of us
knew a single individual who was prescribed meds. (Robert Mallory, we
would find out, was the first.) There were also no DUIs, there were no
overdoses, there were no suicide attempts, and of course, there were no
school shootings anywhere—all of this would come later. And Matt Kellner,
even though he might have been numbed with marijuana and was having a
sexual relationship with me for over a year, was deemed a good kid with
decent grades who kept to himself, living in some kind of underwater fantasy
world: stoned in the pool was where he resided in a marijuana haze and that
was all he ever needed; this was what gave Matt sustenance, the lateafternoon sun, the scent of chlorine, the shade of the palms above the
hammock he rested in, the Specials singing “Ghost Town” coming from a
pool house lined with surfboards and an aquarium that stretched along a wall
he zoned out on while stroking Alex the cat.
—
RON AND SHEILA KELLNER ASSUMED that Matt’s schedule was as
routine that week as it had always been since he moved into the pool house in
the middle of tenth grade, which coincided with when he got his driver’s
license: he would get up early, he would swim some laps, sometimes one
could hear reggae faintly coming from the pool house at that hour, before
Matt left for school, and then he’d pull the red Datsun out of his garage and
head to Buckley. Matt would rarely come up to the main residence to grab
breakfast even though the housekeeper always laid something out in case he
did; he usually preferred to stop by the McDonald’s in Sherman Oaks before
school. For Matt school lasted until three, since he wasn’t involved in sports
or any extracurricular activities, so he was often back at the pool house by
four at the latest. On weekends he would sometimes drive to the beach alone,
down the coast to Newport and beyond, and—this is key—he always left a
note on his desk in the pool house telling whoever came across it where he’d
gone and when he’d be back. On some nights Sheila Kellner would glimpse
the guesthouse from the windows in the second-story master bedroom and the
only light would be coming from the aquarium or from candles Matt had lit,
lined against the pool, where Matt swam until he went to bed, but she rarely
saw him, as if Matt was keeping himself purposefully invisible to his parents.
Sheila noted that she realized over that weekend there was no aqua glow
emanating from the windows of the guesthouse since the aquarium had been
drained, and she didn’t see any candles or hear sounds coming from the pool.
The Jacuzzi hadn’t been used either.
—
AT LUNCH SUSAN TOLD US that the Kellners began cooperating with the
Los Angeles Police Department once it became apparent that no one had seen
Matt for at least three or four days, possibly six—Ron Kellner hadn’t seen his
son since late last week and it was now Wednesday—or knew where he was
and that’s when he became officially missing. The last time Ron Kellner had
seen Matt was the previous Thursday, when he walked down to the pool
house to ask Matt if he had replaced the headlight on the 280ZX and Matt
told him he never drove it at night so what was the hurry—he’d do it next
week. Frustrated—and seeing how stoned his son was while he complained
about how much homework he had to complete—Ron took the Datsun to the
Nissan dealership in Encino, where they quickly replaced the headlight,
serviced the car and adjusted the suspension and then washed it while Ron sat
with the owner of the dealership in his office—and because it was Ron
Kellner it took under an hour instead of leaving the car at the dealership
overnight. Ron returned the car to the pool-house garage, told Matt that the
headlight had been replaced and that if he wanted to keep the car he needed
to take better care of it, and Matt muttered his thanks. It was confirmed that
Matt had been at school the previous Friday and the last person who had seen
him at Buckley was Angelo, the head of security, who had been directing
traffic in the parking lot and remembered Matt driving past him and out the
school gates at roughly three-fifteen—Matt was alone in the car and wearing
sunglasses and Angelo confirmed that there was nothing strange or unusual
about the sighting. The Kellners’ housekeeper saw Matt when he returned to
Haskell Avenue that afternoon.
No one saw him Saturday or Sunday, which, again, wasn’t unusual, and
there wasn’t anything off about Matt not showing up at Buckley on Monday
morning—maybe he wasn’t feeling well, maybe he felt like skipping a day,
maybe he slept in late and decided to hit the beach instead. But he had
probably slipped away sometime that weekend, though no one was even
vaguely certain of this because the Kellners never checked the separate
garage where Matt kept his car—at least not until Wednesday morning, when
Dr. Croft’s secretary called and asked when Matt was returning to school and
Ron Kellner first noticed the red Datsun was missing, and Sheila Kellner
realized she hadn’t seen any lights in the guesthouse all weekend—and it was
odd that the pool was never lit on Saturday or Sunday night. It was also odd
that this time out Matt hadn’t left a note or a message telling anyone that he
was leaving or where he was going or that he wouldn’t be attending school
for the next few days. It became easier to locate how long Matt Kellner had
been missing because of the details Sheila supplied about the lights, even
though she admitted that they didn’t really know precisely if this absence was
“typical” of their only child or not. It wasn’t something that would have
concerned or even worried them otherwise, until they found out that Matt
hadn’t been to school for three days and then the fear set in.
—
THE THING THAT SCARED ME most about Matt’s disappearance was that
I knew it wasn’t random and that something had been leading up to the
disappearance; there were specific details in a narrative that was being carried
out by someone, and on that day Susan announced the disappearance, it
started forming in my mind that maybe Matt had become the fourth victim of
the recently named Trawler, the person who had been responsible for the
home invasions and the abductions and three murders because a similar
pattern had been closing in on Matt: there were the anonymous silent phone
calls, there was the rearranged furniture within the residence, there were the
fish that disappeared, there was the missing cat—we didn’t know the
significance of the posters yet—but I kept forcing myself to calm down
because Matt was male, and so he really wasn’t part of the pattern, and why,
then, should I be so worried about that particular narrative? But my mind
wandered restlessly to the question: What if there wasn’t a pattern? What if
we assumed that there was a pattern and there actually wasn’t—that it was
more random than what it looked like? After all, the home invasions targeted
both women and men—both genders had been bound and assaulted—which
hinted that the Trawler never really adhered to a standard narrative in the first
place when it came to his targets. And what if there had been other victims—
adolescent, male—that no one knew about yet, and not just the three pretty
teenage girls that occupied the media with their youth, their freshness, their
smiles in the photos flashed on the local news as a stinging reminder of how
doomed they all were? I also wondered in the initial days of the
disappearance if Matt was just an unstable dude I never really knew who fled
down the coast for a week just because he didn’t give a fuck and would be
back by next Monday—shake the paranoia that had been gripping him, take a
break from the classmate who’d become obsessed, get out of Encino and
head to Manhattan Beach, Newport, San Diego, wherever.
—
AT THE ASSEMBLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING both Dr. Croft and
Susan mentioned for the first time the disappearance of Matt Kellner in their
separate addresses to the student body and asked anyone who had
information about Matt to please come to the administration office—and no
one did. I noticed that Ryan glanced over at me in the packed courtyard, his
blond hair newly cut and brushed back, looking remarkably composed even
while he kept clenching his jaw. (Or maybe he was just chewing gum, I
hoped. I was turning everything into a drama and trying to pull back from
doing so.) And then, afterward, by the row of lockers the seniors shared,
Ryan asked in a low voice, “Do you know what happened?” He asked me
this, of course, and in such a way, because he was the only one who knew my
history with Matt. I didn’t say anything, just shook my head. Ryan stared,
leaning against his locker. “Well, where do you think he is?” he asked. I
grabbed a book and stared back at Ryan, keeping it together, trying to play
everything casually, Ryan being the last person I wanted to notice how
frightened I actually was by his questions and how they implicated me: Do
you know what happened? Where do you think he is? “I think he’ll be okay,”
I said in a steady voice. “I think he went up to Santa Barbara or Ojai.” Ryan
nodded reluctantly, and then asked me if Matt had ever done anything like
this before—just split without telling anybody. I thought about the last year—
the period between the summer of 1980 and this past Labor Day—and
realized, no, Matt had never done anything like this before. This was, in fact,
very unlike him.
I didn’t tell Ryan that but simply said again, “I think he’ll be okay.”
—
SOMETHING WAS BUILDING WITHIN me and I didn’t know what to do
with it. My mind kept flashing on the phone calls Matt accused me of, the
empty aquarium, the missing cat, Matt’s furious paranoia. What kept
weighing me down with fright was that I knew that something had been
happening to Matt that caused him to disappear—I believed there were forces
beyond Matt’s control that led to his disappearance and had been circling him
weeks before he was “officially” missing. There was no other angle from
which I could look at what happened to Matt Kellner: he had been targeted,
and these forces entered into his life and before it became too late to figure
any of this out they had simply taken him. The nights after I heard of Matt’s
disappearance, and before the body was found, I smoked the weed I bought
from Jeff Taylor to get me to sleep but it was too strong and caused me to
vividly dream until I woke up doused with sweat, paralyzed. What made the
fear that caused the need for the marijuana so maddening was that there was
no one to talk with about the fear or to tell my dreams to or talk about Matt
with: my own girlfriend, who I’d committed myself to, was under the
innocent assumption that Matt had only been my weed dealer and hadn’t
asked me anything else about him since she answered the phone on that
Sunday he called while I was passed out.
When Susan did ask me about Matt after the assembly where she
announced that Matt had disappeared—purposefully not in front of any of our
friends—I just brushed her off. She asked me if I knew anything and when
was the last time I saw him and how close were we really and I hated
everything this intimated and how her questions, like Ryan’s, seemed to
implicate me in Matt’s narrative. My anger about Robert Mallory—that
Susan and Thom talked to him about me—had faded and the only thing I said
to Susan was that Matt had been freaking out about something and I didn’t
know what. But you guys were close, right? Susan asked, insisting. Didn’t
you hang out all the time? Didn’t you spend weekends with him? Weren’t
you good friends? Didn’t he tell you what he was freaking out about? I
realized while we were standing beneath the eaves, about to walk into a
classroom together, that we were talking about an angle that she was
presupposing—that I knew Matt Kellner better than I’d ever revealed, and
that this constituted an intimate relationship Susan was now acknowledging
and that she was certain about and that I was now confirming by answering
her. I don’t think Susan was necessarily intimating that Matt and I were
having actual sex—I had never admitted it to her, she had never flat-out
asked—but she would joke teasingly about our friendship and maybe I
confirmed something by going along with it, never denying the jokes, in fact
making another joke to link with hers. But in the scope of things none of that
mattered—it all seemed small—because another day passed and Matt Kellner
didn’t appear at Buckley on Thursday. And I somehow knew that something
awful had happened to him, and even worse, I thought: if it was at the hands
of the Trawler it might be months before his body was found.
—
AND THEN WE HEARD THAT A BACKPACK was discovered by a
ranger down the coast in a parking lot in Crystal Cove State Park, above a
bluff overlooking the ocean—and it had a name and address tied to it on a
small ID tag that proved it belonged to Matt Kellner. The only reason the
backpack was brought to the attention of the Orange County Police was that
there was blood all over it and the name checked with the missing-person
report that Ron and Sheila Kellner filed with the Los Angeles Police
Department. This was what Susan was told by Dr. Croft, who warned her that
the information was considered too upsetting to reveal to the school at large,
especially the students in seventh and eighth grades, and so Susan just
reiterated at the mid-morning assembly on Friday that Matt Kellner was still
missing and that anyone who had information should please come to the
administration offices, adding that anything offered would be kept
completely confidential—whatever that meant. Was that a message to me?
When I wondered this it made me almost physically sick. There were
moments when I imagined I could walk into the administration office and
control the answers to the questions I’d be asked but I also knew that there
was no way the questioning wouldn’t lead to the sexual nature of our
friendship—it was an inevitability that I didn’t want to face, plus I had no
real info about the disappearance anyway, only my fearful dreams and
fantasies, my writer’s intuition and sense of drama, the things I heard that
weren’t there. But then the fear would ratchet up when I realized I was
perhaps the only person who knew about the aquarium and the rearranged
furniture and the missing cat—it would hit with a queasy force that Matt
probably hadn’t told anyone but me. I’d calm myself with the fact that no one
really knew anything yet and that Matt could totally be fine, lying on a towel
somewhere, glistening with suntan oil, lounging in the autumn heat, stoned,
listening to Foreigner on his Walkman.
—
BUT THE BLOODSTAINED backpack found in the parking lot at that beach
in Orange County was sufficiently ominous to ramp up the fear level. It
simply seemed like the prelude to discovering another death even if no one
was admitting this yet, and after Susan confided in us that she had just
learned this detail that morning questions were asked by our group for which
there were no answers: what was he doing in Crystal Cove State Park, did
Matt inflict a wound upon himself, was that why the backpack was stained
with blood, how much blood was on the backpack, what was in the backpack,
did anyone see if Matt was with someone, why had the backpack been left in
a parking lot, where was his car? But the questions were just perfunctory, a
kind of mimicry I thought the group felt they had to perform, and there was
no real urgency or concern behind any of the questions tossed at Susan—not
from Thom or Debbie or Jeff or Tracy—and since she didn’t have the
answers to any of them the questioning drifted away. I noted that Robert
never asked a single question about Matt, and neither did Ryan. I was the
only one in a state of disbelief that no one seemed to really share—it might
have been “eerie” that a student was missing and “freaky” that the backpack
had been found and “the missing kid” got people mildly excited if only for a
moment, and then school life went on.
Classes weren’t canceled, the parking lot was filled with cars, we went
up to Gilley Field for PE, on that Friday I ate lunch at Du-par’s in Studio City
with Thom and Susan and Debbie, and Matt Kellner’s name didn’t come up
once as I tried not to become that zombie Debbie accused me of playing. I
maintained some surface semblance of pretending life was normal but I was
dying inside and everything was a blur as I sat with Debbie nestled into me
across the booth from Thom and Susan in the diner—just two clean-cut
couples, Buckley kids, ordering grilled cheese sandwiches and vanilla
milkshakes in their preppy uniforms. I had tried to concentrate on my
homework in the empty house on Mulholland but I was relying too much on
the weed I was buying from Jeff Taylor, and getting stoned was now laced
with a new paranoia, it was sharper and more intense and left me completely
in shambles, and I just opted for Valium so at least I could focus on the
assigned reading and complete papers and sit at a desk in an air-conditioned
classroom and fill out the answers in a pop quiz that Mrs. Susskind surprised
us with on Friday afternoon and that I barely managed to pass. Ryan didn’t
come over that weekend—he had intimated earlier that week he would—and
I don’t think I masturbated for six days, from the moment I heard Matt was
missing to when the body was finally found I didn’t want to touch myself.
—
AND THEN IT HAPPENED. Early Saturday morning the gardener arrived at
the Kellners’ address on Haskell Avenue, having heard nothing about Matt’s
disappearance. The gardener walked the side path up from the street and
unlatched the gate that led him to the backyard. There was a utility closet
next to the pool house where trash bins and rakes and hedge clippers were
stored and there was a small window that looked into the garage of the pool
house, where the red Datsun was now parked, though the gardener wouldn’t
have noticed the blood spattered across the passenger seat and dashboard.
The gardener dragged a trash can along the lawn, passing the guesthouse,
when he stopped and smelled something. It was silent in the backyard but
there was the distinct whirring of insects coming from close by and the
gardener couldn’t tell where the odor of rot was emanating from. And then he
saw the body of a cat nailed to one of the wooden columns of the pool house
—but he wasn’t sure if it was the cat the gardener had usually seen prowling
the property because this animal was decapitated. It was tied mid-column
with a belt and oversized nails had been driven into each paw, crucifying the
animal, splaying it out. The cat was eviscerated and a bundle of dark-red,
pink and white intestines hung from where someone had gutted it, gathered
between the cat’s hind legs, where a swarm of flies congregated.
The gardener turned and saw something floating in the pool. It was a
body. It was naked. It wasn’t moving. The arms were extended in front of the
body as if it was in mid-swim and the legs were stretched into a slight V and
the hair was wavy in the blue-lit water, which was lightly rusted with blood.
The build, the color of hair, the height—the gardener recognized it as Matt;
he had seen him enough times over the years to know exactly who this was.
And then the gardener noticed a small object sitting at the edge of the shallow
end, where the steps led into the water. And that was the head of the missing
cat—the cat that was now nailed to the column—its eyes gouged out, its ears
sliced off, and its tongue pulled so far from its mouth that it draped obscenely
across the tile surrounding the pool. The head had been placed in the center
of the coping so that it was directly in line with the corpse suspended in the
water. The pool was very still, the boy in the water was frozen in place, the
only noise the sound of flies. The gardener started running up the lawn
toward the main house, away from the body in the pool and the mutilated
carcass of the cat. This was at eight o’clock Saturday morning, a week after
Matt had probably disappeared.
—
THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT called the school by the
time mid-morning assembly started on Monday and Dr. Croft addressed the
student body after the Pledge of Allegiance and the prayer and intoned there
had been an “unfortunate” event: Matt Kellner, the missing student, had died
over the weekend and everyone’s prayers should be sent to his family. Matt’s
death was referred to as an accident, the student had drowned accidentally in
the pool, Matt had slipped, Matt had hit his head on the pool’s ledge and then
drowned, there was the hint of drugs. This was the official version on that
Monday and Croft did not remind everyone that Matt Kellner had been
missing for a week before this happened or that a bloodstained backpack
belonging to him had been found in a parking lot an hour outside of L.A. On
that Monday they were making it simple, open and shut, not too disturbing:
Matt disappeared, drove around the coast for seven days and then returned to
the house on Haskell Avenue in the middle of the night and tripped into the
pool and accidentally drowned—this was the clean version. This was the
story being pushed, for now, and there was no reason for anybody not to
accept it. On that morning no one knew Croft was going to announce this—
none of us had heard anything about Matt’s death until that moment—so the
surprise of it eradicated any kind of reason to be suspicious. Not even Susan
Reynolds as student-body president had been briefed beforehand. I was too
stunned to feel anything except relief that it didn’t seem to be connected to
the Trawler: it was an accident, Matt had done this to himself, no one else
seemed to be involved. For me, the tension broke that day because of this.
It was as if everything momentarily dissolved—all the worry, all the fear.
Matt was gone, as I knew he would be, it was so inevitable as to be
preordained, the suspense was over, hopefully he was at peace. I had been
expecting a dark and violent outcome, and though I was shocked by the news
I didn’t cry out, I didn’t collapse, I stayed remarkably calm. I simply gasped
quietly and held a hand to my mouth and felt nothing except a mounting
confusion began building on that Monday because after I got over the shock I
didn’t quite believe in the surface narrative of this particular story that was
being offered to us—something started gnawing at me, something was off.
After assembly I skipped Phys Ed, along with most of the senior class, and
drove back to the house on Mulholland and sat in a chaise in the backyard,
completely numb. I didn’t want to see anyone at lunch and I didn’t want to be
asked any questions by Susan or be comforted by Debbie and I didn’t want to
be anywhere near the person Matt had become closest to in the days before
his death: Robert Mallory.
—
IN THE DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT the talk shifted to suicide pretty
quickly in the revolving rumor mill concerning Matt’s death but I believed
this even less than the accidental-drowning theory. There was no way Matt
killed himself: it was completely improbable that he had purposefully
ingested a variety of drugs (weed, ’ludes, acid) and then decided to drown
himself during a psychotic break, no matter how frazzled he was when I last
saw him. The story I began to believe was that Matt had gotten scared: he
realized there was something “wrong” about the phone calls and the
rearranged furniture and the missing cat and left Los Angeles because he felt
targeted—his paranoia was full-blown, I had seen it and I believed this was
what caused him to leave Encino on that weekend without telling anyone, so
no one could find him. He didn’t leave a note because he didn’t want to risk
getting tracked, and he drove down the coast and probably paid cash for
everything and slept in his car—it was certainly warm enough that September
to do this comfortably and it sounded like Matt. There was, however, the
mystery of the bloodstained backpack found at Crystal Cove, in addition to
knowing that Matt never took opiates or hallucinogens. I began to believe
that the death wasn’t accidental or a suicide but that someone else was
involved and helped cause it or actually staged it. Large sections of the
narrative about Matt Kellner’s death were simply missing and on some nights
I’d think maybe logic or coherence didn’t play a part in any of this—and I
was haunted by what Terry Schaffer had said in Trumps when I asked him if
something was weird. “Isn’t everything?” he had asked back, lightly mocking
me.
In the end it played out as an accident that was too banal, boring even,
there wasn’t anything about it to fully engage people—there wasn’t a real
story, no drama, no mystery—and so Matt’s death barely made the news: one
item in the Los Angeles Herald Examiner with a small headline, “Encino
Boy, 17, drowns in pool,” and just a brief obituary in the Los Angeles Times
complete with Matt’s junior yearbook photo appearing within the hundreds of
other obituaries from that week spread over two pages (1964–1981), his face
lost in a sea of old people; there was no funeral or memorial service.
—
A STUDENT DEATH—which had never happened at Buckley while any of
us were there—should have been an occasion. Or at least a bigger moment
than Matt Kellner’s death became, and since it wasn’t an occasion I
processed and accepted it far more easily than I ever could have imagined,
because no one seemed to care—there may have existed the surprise of it but
because it was Matt Kellner it just didn’t carry the weight it would have if
someone more popular had died. If it had been Thom Wright I believe the
campus would’ve shut down for two days so everyone could grieve and
recover, or even Jeff Taylor would have merited some kind of memorial. But
Matt had disappeared into himself and was so invisible over the past few
years that it didn’t seem like such a big deal—he was a stoner, he went
missing, he drowned, he was a weirdo, so what. I ended up being more
shocked than saddened by the way this played out and I never cried, because
I had already cried over Matt Kellner and everything that was lost when I
drove away from the house on Haskell Avenue that hungover Sunday
afternoon. The death struck the campus in a mild, even muted, way because
no one had known Matt.
Even worse, Matt became a punch line, a joke, and, walking through the
hallways between classes, I overheard the occasional comment in those first
days of October after Matt was found dead, with guys mimicking Cheech and
Chong and Mr. Bill (“Oh no, Sluggo! Don’t push me into the pool, Sluggo!”),
and the person who became most activated about Matt’s death was the one
person I wished hadn’t and that was Debbie Schaffer, who didn’t believe I
was okay when I told her in fact I was.
Matt had called the house on Mulholland and only briefly talked to
Debbie but she now created a deeper connection between Matt and myself
after Susan inadvertently told her Matt and I were closer than she might have
thought and Debbie overblew it because she “felt bad” that she had
wrongfully assumed he’d only been my dealer—which is exactly what he
was, I argued. Debbie became “worried” and she didn’t want to let me out of
her sight and canceled a session she booked at Windover so she could follow
me to the house on Mulholland and comfort me, assuming I wanted to lose
myself in sex because of the “friend” I had tragically lost. I didn’t know what
to do with her, so I went with it, using the sexual imagery with Ryan as a way
to get through sex with Debbie, but I couldn’t sustain this for more than a
couple of afternoons and soon I was using Matt’s death as an excuse not to
have sex with Debbie, reiterating that I really was okay and the charity event
she’d been training for was so much more important since there was nothing
anyone could do now: Matt was gone.
There was one person I wanted sex from but Ryan was fading away and
after the announcement of Matt’s death stopped suggesting he should come
over to the house on Mulholland. “You’re not freaked out?” Ryan asked at
the lockers one afternoon that week the body was found. I shook my head
because I didn’t know what else to do. “Well, I’m freaked out for you,” Ryan
said. Ryan hadn’t known Matt—only whatever I had told him—but I realized
increasingly that maybe I hadn’t known Matt either: if it was true he had a
psychotic break after disappearing for a few days and then returned only to
accidentally or purposefully drown himself while on hallucinogens then I
really didn’t know this person. I knew his body intimately—I’d memorized it
—but if this narrative about his death was real then I had to accept that he’d
been a ghost the entire time. But the fact remained that I didn’t believe in the
official narrative: I increasingly believed that someone else was involved
with the death of Matt Kellner and there was a point that week where I began
to suspect that Robert Mallory had something to do with it—that on some
level he had put it into motion.
—
SUSAN REYNOLDS POSTPONED THE PARTY she was throwing for
Robert Mallory until the third Saturday in October, and she told me this as we
sat in her car in the senior parking lot, where moments before we had shared
what should have been a relatively normal scene leading up to getting into the
BMW—we’d been talking about Thom’s upcoming trip back east to visit
colleges and how I hadn’t even met with Mrs. Zimmerman, the school’s
college adviser, let alone planned to visit any campuses yet. Susan believed
she was probably heading to her first choice, UCLA—in fact it was
inevitable, there was no way she wasn’t going to get in. “Yeah, the same with
Thom,” I said. This caused Susan to break out of the pose she’d perfected and
look over at me warily. “We don’t know if Thom is going to UCLA,” she
said. “Why not?” I asked, surprised. “I just told you he’s going to look at
places back east,” she said. I reminded her that the only reason Thom was
going back east was that Lionel, his dad, could take time off to accompany
him to the colleges Thom was supposedly looking at—Syracuse, University
of Connecticut, Boston—even though Thom’s first choice was UCLA and the
trip was to please his father, who was hoping that Thom would attend school
on the East Coast so he could be nearer to him. “You know that,” I said to
Susan. The conversation, which should have been tinged with excitement, I
remember, had become sullen and resigned, and I noticed bitterly that this
mood didn’t have anything to do with Matt Kellner; he seemed to have
already been forgotten—Susan was distracted by something bigger, or so I
presumed. And then she leaned over and turned up the volume on the car’s
stereo.
—
THERE WAS A SONG Susan and I shared, sung by a group called Icehouse,
from Australia, and it was now playing in the car as we sat there after school
while she smoked a clove cigarette and stared out the windshield and I just
looked at her, struck by how beautiful she’d become—this new beauty which
seemed to have blossomed almost overnight. Why didn’t you end up with
her? Robert Mallory asked me in the space on Melrose—a night that seemed
a thousand years ago. I remembered the first time I noticed Susan—it was at
a party Anthony Matthews (always trying to be the most popular boy in our
class) threw in the first weeks of seventh grade where she suddenly appeared
in Calvin Klein jeans and a halter top and walked down the steps toward the
pool just as the opening riff of “Saturday Night” by the Bay City Rollers
blared from the outside speakers as if she was a girl in a movie we were all
standing in, and later we watched her blithely gyrate to “Boogie Fever” with
Jeff Taylor, who we thought she was going to end up with, but nothing
happened. And I remember the following year, when I was allowed to join a
sleepover at Debbie’s, Susan and I finally connected and became closer than
we ever had, while the group watched Carrie on the Z Channel, and then for
some reason I remember a few years later touching her thigh while watching
Fame at the Cinerama Dome after school, a movie Thom didn’t want to see,
just to test her, to gauge how serious Susan was about Thom, who she’d been
dating for almost nine months by then—this was in May of 1980—and she
didn’t push my hand away and I finally removed it myself. And I thought of
all the corny songs that Susan and I bonded over, and that Thom and Debbie
didn’t like: Neil Diamond and “If You Know What I Mean” and Barry
Manilow and “Tryin’ to Get the Feeling Again” and “Weekend in New
England” and everything by the Carpenters. Why didn’t you end up with her?
I knew why and yet I also didn’t know—it shouldn’t have happened but it
could have happened—it wasn’t because I also liked boys. There was
something that seemed unattainable about Susan and I guess in the end I
preferred her that way—the inevitable reality would have been too crushing.
—
WE’D BEEN PLAYING THE ICEHOUSE song since it came out—it was
the first track on the band’s debut—and we had bought it together at the
Tower Records on Sunset one day in the last week of school our junior year
and then drove around that afternoon listening to it and rewinding the cassette
so we could experience the song over and over, surprised at how much we
liked it since we’d never heard it before. Susan had bought the cassette for
the single that was being played on KROQ, the upbeat pop song “We Can
Get Together,” but this other track became a song only Susan and I knew;
Debbie didn’t know it, Thom didn’t know it, Ryan didn’t know it. The song
was something Susan and myself shared, referencing it secretly, as if it was a
coded message only the two of us found meaning in. It was a ballad about a
girl outside an icehouse where the rivers never freeze, and the singer tells us
that the girl is dreaming of a new love but she has to wait so long for him
because he needs another year, and in the second verse we learn that the devil
lives inside the icehouse—he came with the winter snow, the singer tells us—
and the girl is dreaming through the summer and hoping through the spring
and she can’t remember getting any older. The vocals were wavering and
slightly robotic behind a drum machine and a minor-chord synthesizer
melody but it became warmer when it moved into a new key—it sounded
ominous until it wasn’t. There’s a break, a bridge, where the tension is
heightened and then it flies into one last chorus as the synth hook keeps
cascading over the song. It had an aching, dreamy quality and it soared—it
was like all the songs from that year, an anthem, and it appealed to the
dramatic ways we saw ourselves ending with the narrator who has been
watching the girl through the trees outside the icehouse singing, Now it’s
colder every day. It ends with a simple admission—There’s no love inside the
icehouse—and the song doesn’t fade, it just ends.
I remember the power the song had the first time we played it in Susan’s
car as we drove across Sunset Boulevard and through Beverly Hills and the
vocals were yearning for something better than what the lyrics offered and
the chorus was about dreams, about hope, which were intensified by the
doomy romanticism of the overall track itself. I realized the song was about
Susan and it was about Thom, because this was the moment Susan was
revealing to me that her feelings for Thom had fissures, a crack was
appearing—she had first admitted this only two weeks earlier, in Westwood,
before we even heard the song. Thom isn’t dumb exactly…and the song
seemed to sum up Susan in that moment. She was the girl outside the
icehouse dreaming of a new love and Thom was the love the girl hopes will
be there soon, but what made it so sad is that Thom was already there and it
was obvious that Susan was waiting for someone else, and the devil was the
reason this was happening—but who was the devil? (I thought for a while it
was me, but it turned out to be Robert Mallory.) The song saddened me and
gave me hope—the best combination for a pop song—and as we listened to it
throughout the summer it kept confirming something about Susan and her
mild dissatisfaction, the way she had consciously been numbing herself, and
why she had brought up Thom’s trip back east to visit colleges, as if she
thought this was proof things might end by the time senior year was over, or
maybe even before. But I also knew: there was no way Thom Wright was
feeling the same narrative.
—
THE SONG ENDED—it had put me in a solemn mood and I was still briefly
emotional because of it. I realized I was staring at Susan’s breasts beneath her
unbuttoned blouse and then I focused on anything else: the tin of Djarum
cigarettes and the Tic-Tacs on the dashboard, various cassettes: the Go-Go’s,
the Clash, Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar, the Psychedelic Furs. And then I
focused on Thom’s Corvette through the windshield and, beyond it, a few
spaces away, Robert Mallory’s black Porsche gleaming darkly in the parking
lot. Our world would die, I suddenly thought: it was inevitable.
“Can I ask you something?” Susan said.
“Yes,” I said.
“What was going on between you and Matt?” she asked softly. “Can you
tell me? Can you be honest with me?”
I didn’t say anything, just stared straight ahead. Another song began but
Susan turned down the volume. And I was briefly touched when I realized
that Susan actually had been thinking about Matt in that moment and that I’d
been wrong in assuming she wasn’t. I didn’t say anything because I had no
idea what to say.
“It can be a secret,” she finally said. “I won’t tell anyone.”
“Why would it have to be a secret?” I asked.
She sighed. “Okay. Whatever.”
“What do you want to know, Susan?”
“I just want to know…what he meant to you, I guess,” she said. “What
was your friendship like?” She stopped and then tentatively asked, “Was it
more than a friendship?”
“Meaning what?”
Carefully, she said, “Were you hooking up?”
I wasn’t shocked. I wasn’t surprised. This was simply the moment when
I could go either way—it was an offer to come clean. I could maintain a lie,
and keep everything evasive, and make sure the world kept running smoothly
in our little group at Buckley, or just finally admit it to her and let the drama
pour out of me within what I assumed was the safety of our friendship, and
yet I didn’t know if I trusted Susan in the way I once had—because of Robert
Mallory—and in that same moment she asked me the question I realized I
couldn’t tell her the truth and this revelation was so sudden and landed with
such force that any hope of relief was wiped away. I could only be half
honest with her—I had known Susan for a long time and I loved her in such a
way that meant I could never fully lie to her and up to that point I never had.
But we weren’t there anymore.
“I didn’t really know him,” I started. “We hung out and sometimes
something happened. I don’t know why or how. But, yeah, we hooked up a
couple times.”
“Only a couple?” she asked, unfazed that I’d admitted this.
I calmly shrugged and didn’t say anything else.
“So it wasn’t…a serious thing?” she asked.
“It was an…experiment. I was experimenting.” I looked straight ahead
through the windshield, completely drained, when I said this. “Susan, if you
tell anybody, if you tell Thom or Debbie or Robert, I swear I’ll—”
“Stop it,” she said, cutting me off. “Of course I’m not going to tell
anybody. Why would I want to tell Thom or Debbie or Robert this?” She was
looking at me. “This is a secret, I get it.” She paused. “It was between you
and Matt. It’s nobody’s business.”
I remember I felt nothing admitting this half-truth—even a quarter of the
reality, denying the passion of it on my part—and this was proof that I was
moving away from Susan, from the group, from everyone. She had told me in
so many ways that she knew something had been going on with Matt, not at
first, but obviously we were closer than I’d let on. It was a friendship we
sometimes joked about, but then, I only realized now, the joking had stopped.
At a certain point Susan started understanding there was something else
going on with Matt Kellner.
“I really didn’t know him,” I said. “I mean I don’t know what was going
on with him.” I stopped, and lamely gestured with my hands. “I guess we
were friends, but maybe not.” I stopped again. “It was…confusing, I guess.” I
looked over at her. “It was an experiment.”
“But you liked him?”
“I didn’t know him.”
“What does that mean?”
“It means I didn’t know him,” I said. “It means I don’t know what
happened to him. If I had known him I think his death would’ve made sense.
But I guess I didn’t know him because this wouldn’t have happened to the
Matt I thought I knew.” I was rambling, confused, blushing.
“But I didn’t ask you that,” she said quietly. “I asked if you liked him.”
“What do you mean?” I asked. “Like, was I in love with him? Jesus.” I
turned away, pretending to be disgusted.
Susan was quiet, contemplating what I’d just told her.
“Someone told me you guys had a falling out,” she said.
The shock I felt in that moment—the betrayal—was massive and it hit
immediately. I had to grip my fists to combat a wave of anger that slammed
against me.
I almost got out of the car but I controlled myself. “What do you mean?”
I asked once again in a flat, low voice.
She sighed, uncertain if she should go on, but then decided to.
“Robert told me that you and Matt had a falling out,” she said. “But a
falling out about what?”
“Why would Robert Mallory tell you this?” I couldn’t help but use his
full name when I asked her that.
“I don’t know,” she said. “Why would Robert tell me that? I guess he
had talked to Matt and Matt told him.” She paused. “What was the falling out
about?”
“Well, didn’t Robert find out and tell you?” I asked, continuing to
control myself so I didn’t spit this out at her, so my features wouldn’t become
twisted with rage, so that my hands wouldn’t gnarl into claws, so I wouldn’t
let her see what I was really feeling in that moment. Instead my mood
remained placid, my face blank.
“He said he didn’t know,” Susan said. “Just that Matt said he had this
falling out with you over something and it kind of bummed Matt out.”
Hearing this killed me. I kept steady. “Well, I don’t know what that
would have been,” I murmured. “I mean, I told Matt that he was smoking too
much weed and I couldn’t deal with his paranoia and stuff like that and if he
was going to get so high all the time what was the point of us hanging out.”
Susan listened to this lie and nodded. “Did you, like, break off the
friendship with him?”
I shrugged. “Yeah, I guess, but not really. I just…um…admonished
him.”
“Admonished him?” she asked, confused. “Admonished?”
“Yeah, about, um, how much, um, weed he was smoking,” I said
haltingly.
“Do you think this had anything to do with him not coming to school and
disappearing—”
“Susan—” I warned.
“No, I’m serious—”
“Susan—” I warned again, this time louder.
“Was Matt upset enough to—”
“Kill himself?” I asked. “Are you fucking kidding me?” I turned around
in the passenger seat and was facing her. “It was an accident. What are you
implying?” I asked. “You can’t start making up shit like this—”
“Why are you so defensive?” she asked, reaching over and grabbing my
hand.
“Because you’re implying whatever happened to Matt I had something to
do with and that’s bullshit,” I said, pulling my hand away.
“Bret, please, I’m not suggesting that,” she said. “I just thought maybe
you knew why Matt thought you guys had a falling out.”
“No, I don’t,” I said, calmly. “I have no idea what he was referring to.
And by the way Robert already asked me about this and I told him I had no
idea. What are you talking to Robert Mallory about? You’re talking to him
about me? He’s a fucking freak, Susan—”
“Bret,” she said softly, reaching again for the hand I’d pulled away. “I’m
sure Matt’s death was hard to deal with…for you…and I’m not implying
anything.” She paused. “And this has nothing to do with Robert.”
“But he’s the one who made this shit up—”
“What did he make up?”
“Oh, fuck it, I’m okay,” I stressed. “I’m really okay.” I pulled my hand
away from her again. “It’s all fine, Susan. It’s all fine.”
“Are you sure?” Susan said. “You can tell me, you can talk to me.”
“Susan,” I said. “What do you want to hear?”
“Whatever you want to tell me,” she said. “It’s just us.”
“You think I had something to do with Matt’s death—”
“That’s not fair!” she exclaimed. “I never said that! Why are you such a
fucking drama queen?”
“You’re implying it!” I raised my voice. I was almost shouting. “Robert
Mallory is implying it!”
“Bret, you’ve got to calm down,” she said. “You don’t need to get angry
with me. I’m just trying to help. I’m the only one who seems to care about
Matt. I’m the only one asking you these things.” She paused. “And you’re so
resentful…”
“You’re right, you’re right, that’s not what I meant.”
“Jesus, Bret,” she muttered.
“But why was Robert so interested in Matt?”
“I don’t think Robert was so interested in Matt—”
“He was always hanging out with him,” I said. “He was hanging out with
him more than I was.”
“That’s because you had a falling out, right?” she exclaimed, looking at
me, her eyes wide with disbelief. “That’s because you ‘admonished’ him.”
She kept staring as if she couldn’t understand me. “You abandoned a friend
and yet you’re upset with Robert for trying to meet new friends and trying to
be friends with Matt?”
“Susan,” I said, “Robert didn’t want to be friends with Matt—”
“How do you know that? You don’t know that—”
“I’m sorry I’m not a member of the fucking Robert Mallory fan club but
I don’t believe Robert wanted to be friends with Matt Kellner—”
“I just want to know one thing,” Susan said, cutting me off.
“Okay,” I said. “Yeah?”
“When did it stop with Matt?” She paused, then clarified. “The two of
you fooling around.”
“Why?” I asked. “What does it matter?”
She thought about it and then measured her words carefully. “It matters
to me because Debbie is my best friend.”
I slowly nodded when I realized what she meant, what she was really
asking, the time line.
“I think it was May,” I said, and then continued haltingly. “Nothing…
happened over the, um, summer.”
“So nothing happened between you and Matt when you started dating
Debbie?”
I hated the way she asked this. I hated that this mattered to her. I hated
the way she used the word dating. It suggested a different Susan than the
numb, uncaring beauty I had become so enamored of in the past few weeks.
It suggested that there were rules we needed to follow and a kind of propriety
I thought Susan had abandoned. She was confirming we were in high school,
where there were football games and assemblies and prom kings and
Homecoming queens and boys didn’t fuck each other and everyone was
faithful and abided by the laws we set up and conformed to. A year ago I
might have admitted this disgust to Susan when she said this and I could have
told her I felt this way over the summer. But something had changed since
then and now I couldn’t.
“Yeah, that’s right,” I said. “I didn’t want anything to happen.” I
stopped. “I was with Debbie. And I think…” I realized a different narrative, a
new take, and I went there. It formulated quickly. It solved everything.
“Yeah?” Susan asked, waiting.
“And I think…that was something that really upset Matt,” I said. “I think
that was what started driving us apart.” I paused for emphasis. “Debbie. It
was my relationship with Debbie.” I nodded as if realizing this for the first
time. “That she had become my girlfriend…”
Susan thought about this and nodded slightly as if she understood. And
what made the moment so much worse was that she exhibited relief and
relaxed. This lie caused a small wave of nausea to crest over me but then it
dissolved when I realized it was all going to play.
“You can never tell her, Susan. Please.” I turned to her, desperate. “She
can never know. It would fuck everything up.”
“I know, I know,” she said, thinking things through. “I won’t say
anything, I won’t say anything,” she said, reaching for my hand. “I promise.”
“Thank you” was all I could say. “Thank you,” I said again.
She looked back at me and tried to lighten the moment by saying, “Your
secret is safe with me,” but now it sounded ironic, not lightly joking like all
the other times she’d said this, and I suddenly realized there was bemusement
intertwined with her relief and I reacted to the irony by mimicking a shy
schoolboy smiling bashfully and turning away. This made her laugh.
12
I LEFT SUSAN’S CAR and walked over to the Mercedes and opened the
door and sat in the driver’s seat and knew automatically I would be heading
to Matt Kellner’s house without having any idea why I was doing this. There
were simply no other thoughts. I was completely calm as I nodded at Miguel,
who was directing traffic in the Buckley parking lot that afternoon, and then
drove past the gates and onto Stansbury. I drove along Valley Vista in a daze,
heading toward Encino, but when I turned onto Haskell and arrived at Matt’s
house I was suddenly struck with a fear I had never experienced before—it
was adrenaline that acted as a warning for me to save myself but also mixed
with an overwhelming compulsion to move forward no matter how I felt, and
find out whatever I thought I needed to know. I parked where I usually
parked; the street looked the same, the house looked the same. The only
difference in this section of the movie: Matt was dead.
I walked the path to the gate, surprised to find I could unlatch it as easily
as I had a hundred times before—it wasn’t locked, as I’d expected. I walked
the pathway as I had a hundred times—usually in a heightened state of erotic
excitement, of which I was now uncomfortably reminded—to the back of the
property and stopped when I saw the pool house and involuntarily took in a
deep breath: the sight of it caused me to start panicking about some vague
and nameless thing. But then I realized the panic was simply connected to the
fact that this was the place where Matt and I had existed, the only place I ever
saw him except Buckley, and the pool house itself held just as much meaning
to me as Matt actually had—and now it was tainted by death, a haunted
place. The fear and adrenaline and panic were suddenly engulfed by an ache I
was surprised I felt, like the moment you suddenly heard sad music playing
over a particular image in a movie, even though I realized “Ghost Town” was
the last song I heard here—decidedly not a sad song. I drifted toward the
front door not knowing what I expected but the yellow crime-scene tape
crossing the entrance I’d anticipated wasn’t there (because Matt’s death
wasn’t a crime, right?) though I noticed a column wrapped in what looked
like a sheet of blue plastic that offered the suggestion something criminal had
taken place (I knew nothing yet about the cat nailed to the column) and then I
was touching the doorknob. I was surprised, again, that it turned, and the door
opened, and I was allowed access. And I just stood there in the fading
afternoon light, realizing at seventeen that I was already staring into my past
—that the past had a meaning that would always define you. I remember this
being one of my first moments nearing adulthood, when I realized how
powerful memory was—or at least it was the first time it hurt the most. And
there was nothing I could do about the pain of the past—it just settled over
me. The pool house and Matt were a part of my life that had happened and
now they were gone. That was all. No one else knew about it. No one cared.
—
THE ROOM SEEMED even more barren than it was the last time I’d been in
it, when Matt, in the lime-green bathing suit and the Dodgers T-shirt, recoiled
from me reaching out to him. My eyes scanned the space—I had never seen it
this clean before. I quickly averted my eyes from the bed, which was really
now just a mattress, the cardigan sheets had been stripped from it. I noted the
surfboards stacked against each other (just a decorative touch—Matt never
surfed) and the shellacked dolphin curved and mounted above the empty
aquarium that ran along the wall as I moved deeper into the room—it smelled
musty, unaired, as if no one had been in it for a long time. I had noted the
stereo and the records neatly lined on the floor next to one of the speakers
when I saw the Foreigner 4 poster above the hamper and it inexplicably
chilled me—the poster that had been left in Matt Kellner’s mailbox by
someone. I moved forward until I was standing in front of it, gazing at the
image as if it held a mysterious meaning that needed to be deciphered, but
none existed. I opened the refrigerator: the weed was gone; only a couple of
Corona bottles and a lone can of Cactus Cooler remained. I went to his desk,
where schoolbooks were neatly stacked next to a Smith-Corona typewriter:
the drug paraphernalia—the bongs, the pipes, the rolling papers—were
nowhere in sight. I started to pull open the drawers, which were mostly empty
except for the occasional notepad and pen, a stapler and a small box of paper
clips, a pencil sharpener, a calculator, a ruler (I had used it once to measure
our erections), and I was surprised to find an issue of Hustler in the bottom
drawer and wondered why no one had gotten rid of it when everything else
seemed so studiously cleaned. I had just picked up one of the pads when I
noticed on the top page a phone number and the letters RM jotted down in
Matt’s oversized, looping handwriting, and I froze. I don’t know why but I
immediately picked up the green rotary phone on Matt’s desk to dial the
number, and nothing happened—the line was disconnected. RM was Robert
Mallory—there was no doubt. I tore the piece of paper from the pad and
slipped it into the pocket of my slacks. I assumed Matt had a school roster
that contained Robert Mallory’s phone number, so why would Matt need to
write it down? And then I thought: maybe Robert Mallory had another phone
number, maybe he had a separate number, a private number, and this was the
one he had given Matt. Or maybe this was the number in the roster and I was
hearing things that weren’t there because I was the writer.
—
I BECAME DISTRACTED when I noticed a stack of neatly folded clothes
on the bedroom bench pushed against the stripped mattress—they had been
washed but I wondered when they had been left out. Had they been cleaned
while Matt was missing that week and stacked and folded for him when he
returned from wherever he was, or had they been washed after his body was
found in the pool—part of a continuing schedule in the rituals enacted by the
Kellners trying to maintain a façade of normalcy in the face of their son’s
death. I found the Dodgers T-shirt and lifted it up to smell it but there was no
trace of Matt’s scent. And then my eyes landed on three pairs of white jockey
shorts next to the T-shirts and an overwhelming signal of lust pulsed within
me and I picked one of them up and pressed it to my face, inhaling deeply,
pushing it into my mouth, tasting it, chewing on it—I couldn’t help myself.
They were clean: there were no stains, no odor, no hint of Matt, everything
about him washed away. I immediately stopped, embarrassed, and shoved the
underwear into my pants pocket, where I tried to flatten it out so it wouldn’t
bulge. I checked the pool-house garage and it was empty: the red Datsun was
no longer there. And as I walked out for the final time I realized something I
hadn’t noticed when I first arrived: the pool had been drained—it was
completely empty and totally dry, and it looked diminished without the water,
just a small hole of white concrete. My heart stopped when I saw the
hammock tied between the trunks of the two palm trees and remembered the
first time I saw Matt naked there, on that July afternoon in 1980.
—
AS I LEFT THE POOL HOUSE the sprinklers were spraying across the lawn
that led up to the main residence—a massive two-story English Tudor,
impossibly wide and probably built in the mid-1960s—and I saw someone
sitting at a table in the gazebo off to the side of the lawn that ran up to the
house and surrounded by flowers, blue-violet and golden yellow. I had
noticed the gazebo before—it was large and white with an ivied roof—but I’d
never seen anyone sitting in one of the patio chairs situated around the small
table at its center. And there was a woman in one of the chairs, smoking a
cigarette, wearing a tennis skirt mismatched with a flower-patterned blouse,
her long tan legs crossed, and she was barefoot, blankly assessing me as I
decided to move across the lawn toward her because I felt caught and needed
to explain who I was. I realized this was Matt’s mother, Sheila.
I supposed I must have seen her at various school events but her face
didn’t remind me of anyone I’d met before. I’d only known Matt, and even
though I’d been coming over to Haskell Avenue for about a year I was never
introduced to Sheila or his father, Ronald. I actually had never been inside the
main house. Sheila’s brown hair was shoulder-length and a pair of sunglasses
were pushed above her chic blunt bangs and she looked older than most of
our mothers—a woman probably in her late forties. I knew nothing about
Sheila: Matt didn’t complain or say anything complimentary about his
mother—he never mentioned her. I wasn’t wearing the blazer but I had the
rest of the Buckley uniform on—the striped tie was loosened, my sleeves
were rolled up—and I supposed my youth was what caused her to remain
calm at the appearance of this stranger walking toward her, though I realized
almost immediately as I moved halfway up the steps leading into the gazebo
that she was sedated and this was what caused her stillness and kept
everything calm and light; as I got closer I saw that she looked, in fact, deadeyed and stunned. The only movement was when she crushed the cigarette
out in an ashtray next to a pack of Pall Malls. She waited as I stood there not
knowing what to say.
“Yes?” she finally asked. “Can I help you?”
I didn’t know how to explain that something had compelled me to drive
to the Kellner residence and why I was standing in front of her in this
moment. I was suddenly shocked when I realized that she had probably
watched me walk into the pool house from the pathway and emerge moments
later and that I was going to have to give her some kind of reasonable answer
as to why I was standing there even though I didn’t have one myself.
“I’m a friend of Matt’s,” I said softly, then realized. “I was a friend of
Matt’s.”
Her head slightly tilted when I said this, and in the same stunned voice
asked, “A friend?” She paused. “Of Matthew’s?”
“Yes, I’m Bret,” I said. “Bret Ellis. I’m in Matt’s class.” I paused. “At,
um, Buckley,” I mindlessly clarified.
The silence that followed suggested she had no idea who I was but raised
her eyes involuntarily as if surprised.
“We’ve never met,” she said, looking me over with a blankness that
seemed completely natural under the circumstances but unnerved me
anyway.
“No, we never have,” I said. “But I came over often.” I paused. “To see
Matt.” I paused again. “To swim and hang out.”
“Oh,” she said. “So that was your car I always saw? The green sedan?”
“Yeah,” I said, and then, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry about what happened
—”
“But what happened?” she asked in the same toneless voice. She asked
this too quickly—it overlapped with my condolences.
“I’m…Excuse me?” I automatically asked dumbly, confused.
“But what happened?” she asked again, reaching for another cigarette,
which she slipped out of the pack and placed between her lips, and the flame
from a gold lighter quickly lit it. She exhaled as she continued staring at me. I
noticed the half-full glass of orange juice next to the ashtray and the
burgeoning alcoholic in me wondered if there was vodka in it.
“What do you…mean?” I asked, trying to sound sympathetic though my
features were creased with confusion. The scene had reduced me to an actor
and I was struggling with my lines, trying to hit the right notes and get on her
level.
“I mean,” she began in that toneless voice with the blank stare, “we don’t
know what happened to my son.” She paused before adding, “Exactly.”
There was a silence between us, just the sound of the sprinklers spraying
over the vast lawn, their rhythmic click-clacking occasionally adding to the
soundtrack of the movie we were in.
“I don’t know…what happened,” I said, aware that a pair of Matt’s
jockey shorts were in the pocket of the gray slacks I was wearing, pressed
against my thigh. I shifted and took a step back on the stairs leading up to
where Sheila Kellner sat in the center of the gazebo and glanced at the empty
pool and the barren guesthouse. “He had…an accident. It was an accident. I
mean, right?” I asked tentatively, looking back at her but barely meeting her
gaze.
She was obviously in pain and confused—you could sense it in her eyes
and her stillness as if there was an aura of bewilderment surrounding her, but
whatever medication she had taken blunted this to the point where she could
talk about Matthew without breaking down. And then she asked, “Do you
know if he got into a fight with anybody?”
This was something so out of the range from what I expected that I had
to wait a moment to collect myself, and then asked, “A fight?”
“Yes,” she said, inhaling on the cigarette. “An altercation?”
“What do you mean?” I murmured.
She answered with a stoned nonchalance. “He was bruised,” she said.
“He was very bruised. The side of his face was bruised.”
Again, I didn’t know what to say. “Maybe that happened when he fell?” I
made a gesture with my hands, hopelessly. “Into the pool. And, um…hit his
head?”
“No,” she said, and then, clarifying, “he had bruises on his chest and
back. His legs.”
I wasn’t prepared for any of this. I hadn’t expected to see Sheila Kellner.
I had no idea I would be having a conversation with my dead friend’s mother.
Standing on the steps of the gazebo was almost intolerable. Bruises? There
were bruises all over Matt? This was a movie I was totally lost in. I retraced
my steps, found myself back in the scene and improvised my lines. “Does
anyone know where…he went that week? Maybe something happened
wherever…he went.” I paused and for a moment was genuinely scared. The
bruises? No one had mentioned anything about bruises. “Maybe…the bruises
happened then?”
Sheila said nothing. She looked from me to the faraway pool house and
then at my face, completely expressionless.
“I mean, didn’t they find his backpack at…that beach,” I said quietly, “in
that parking lot?” I was speaking so softly I could barely hear myself. “At…
Crystal Cove.”
“Matt didn’t play sports,” she said, as if she hadn’t heard me.
“Not that I know of—”
“So that wasn’t it,” she said, exhaling smoke. “I think it was maybe from
surfing,” she said quietly. “I think he went surfing and maybe that’s when the
bruises happened.” She paused and looked at me but it was without
conviction. “The bruises seemed so odd but it was probably from surfing.” I
just nodded, trying to placate her. I knew Matt didn’t surf and yet Sheila
thought her son was a surfer and I realized with a shocking and intimate
finality that Sheila Kellner really didn’t know her son. But I was reminded
that I hadn’t known him either—no one had. And then it was as if Sheila had
suddenly floated into a new area of sedation—she seemed even further away
from me when she asked, “Why did you come here?” It wasn’t chilly and
there was nothing accusatory about the question—it just came out like a dull
inquiry, as if she really didn’t care about my answer. I was surprised that she
was able to hold the cigarette as steadily as she did—she smoked with her left
hand, I noticed, and I glimpsed the diamond wedding ring on her finger. The
movement of the hand lowering to the ashtray and rising back to her mouth
was completely robotic, aided by whatever was sedating her.
“I came over…” I started, then stopped. “I came over because I wanted
to find out what happened to Matt.” Sheila Kellner stared at me for a long
time with an unstinting gaze.
And after I left Haskell Avenue that afternoon, I realized, chillingly, in
that moment, she was thinking: No, you don’t. You don’t really want to find
out what happened to my son. But I didn’t know that then, while I was
standing on the steps of the gazebo. She finally said, “You can talk to my
husband. He’s in his office.”
—
THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR leading into the kitchen was halfway open
and there was a Mexican housekeeper in a maid’s uniform wearing rubber
gloves up to her elbows silently scrubbing the stovetop as I walked in and
quietly closed the door, uncertain if I should. She turned her head to glance at
me but without surprise. She took note of the school uniform and knew who I
was: a friend of Matt’s. But she was grim-faced and didn’t say anything. She
picked up a spray can of Easy-Off and was now heading toward the open
oven as I tentatively moved through the kitchen—“I’m looking for Matt’s…I
mean, Ronald, Mr. Kellner, Señor Kellner…” was my halting explanation.
The maid shrugged, and said something in Spanish that meant he was in la
oficina and turned back to the oven. Past the kitchen a hallway led into a
dining area, where I walked by a chrome-and-glass table with a potted fern in
the middle of it and that sat on an expanse of off-white shag carpeting, which
flowed into a sunken living room situated at the front of the house, where bay
windows revealed the circular brick driveway and a view of Haskell Avenue.
Once in the living room I could hear a voice somewhere within the house and
moved to the staircase in the foyer, where my hand rested on a polished redoak railing until I could locate exactly where the voice was coming from—it
wasn’t upstairs, I realized, and then turned toward a hallway that took me to
the other side of the house.
—
THE HOUSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPRAWLING but so silent it was easy
to locate Ronald Kellner—I followed his voice down another hallway. The
voice was quiet and tired, often muttering to whoever he was on the phone
with. I turned into a large room that I assumed was Ronald’s office, lined
with the same off-white shag carpeting, and the generic pseudo-impressionist
paintings my father also bought from the Wally Finley Gallery in Beverly
Hills, and there was a kaleidoscope and an opened backgammon board on a
low coffee table that sat in front of a wine-colored sofa and above that a
panoramic view of the backyard. I later found out that Ronald Kellner ran
one of the most powerful legal firms in L.A. (I’m not going to name it or
make up a name for it) and the offices were based in Century City and
represented, again I later found out, a group of clients in the real-estate and
entertainment industries and the law firm had fifteen lawyers on its payroll in
a number of suites in the Century Plaza Towers. But I didn’t know any of this
yet on that afternoon when I visited the Kellners.
Matt had never mentioned his father or what he did, because I guess I’d
never asked, or maybe I had and didn’t remember during all the long and
aimless conversations over our year together, in which topics never got
personal until the final week, when I’d pushed it, so of course I didn’t know
what Matt’s dad did for a living and I never cared—when I was with Matt I
often just got on his wavelength, talked about whatever he was interested in
and then used him for sex, I realized while standing in the doorway of Ronald
Kellner’s office. He was in his early-to-mid-fifties—reminding me again that
this was an older parent than those of most of our classmates in twelfth grade
—and he was tall with thinning gray hair and a neatly trimmed beard. What
struck me most about Mr. Kellner was that he appeared normal—nondescript
beige slacks, a Polo shirt tucked in, he was wearing a belt, he was wearing
loafers—and I wondered briefly why he didn’t look like a mess, stomping
around in pajamas and tear-faced, anguished and gripping a half-empty bottle
of gin because his only child had just died. Ronald Kellner was capable of
presenting himself as if this dreadful event had never happened. He looked
completely professional on that afternoon despite the death of Matt.
—
RONALD KELLNER HELD the receiver to the side of his head as he stared
out the bay window, the chord of the phone reaching from his desk to where
he stood, looking out at the gazebo his wife was sitting in. I wasn’t even
listening to what Ronald was occasionally muttering into the phone because I
was glancing at various mimeographed photos on his desk, which was strewn
with papers and files and manila envelopes beneath a large metal Tensor
lamp—the only instance of disorder within the neat and lavishly decorated
office. He noticed me when he turned around and just stared blankly,
unsmiling, as he continued the call. Again, I don’t remember what he was
saying, but it was quiet and strained, and when he walked over to the desk to
hang the phone up his expression became lightly curious as his eyes scanned
the uniform and then my face and asked, “Are you Robert?” I suppose I
wasn’t as shocked as I want to remember being when he asked that—if I was
Robert—because I was able to calmly say, “No, I’m Bret.” I paused. “I’m
Bret Ellis. I go to Buckley. Mrs. Kellner told me you were in your office and
that I could come in.”
“Who are you?” he asked again, confused.
“I was a friend of Matt’s,” I said.
“A friend?” he asked. “His friend?”
“Yeah, we’re in the same class at Buckley.”
“You’re Matt’s friend from Buckley,” he asked, just standing there.
“Well, yeah, we hung out,” I said. “Sometimes I came over and…hung
out.”
He stared, large hands on his hips, studying me with a new grimness that
hardened his expression. “How well did you know him?” he asked.
“Well, I’ve known him since seventh grade,” I said. “When he came to
Buckley.” I paused. “But we became friends last year.”
“You became friends with my son?” he asked. “Last year?”
I nodded.
The grimness turned into something else: a kind of suspicion joined it
and Ronald cocked his head. “How well do you think you knew him?” he
asked. “Matthew.”
I realized I had to tell the truth. “I don’t know.” I sighed. “After what
happened I really don’t know.”
This truthful admission softened Ronald—the grimness and suspicion
left his face and he looked down. “What are you doing here?” he asked too
softly. “What do you want?”
I don’t know why I expected affection from him or even a kind of
removed emotional response because of my presence but he seemed slightly
exasperated that I was in his office—a stranger who admitted that he’d been
friends with his son but didn’t really know him. This wasn’t exactly true,
because I knew Matt in ways more intimate than any person I’d ever met up
until that moment in my life, but I couldn’t admit this to his father.
“I cared about Matt” was all I said.
“You cared about my son?” Ronald asked. “That’s why you’re here?”
“I just…I just wanted to find out what happened.”
He was staring at me again with mild suspicion. We didn’t say anything
—we just kept looking at each other blankly until it became too
uncomfortable and I finally said, “I’m sorry I bothered you,” and then, “I’m
sorry about Matt.” I waited a beat before I turned to exit, aware again that
Matt’s jockey shorts were pressed into my pocket.
“You wanted to find out what happened?” Ron asked flatly.
“Yeah.” I paused. “It was an accident, right? It was an accident in the
pool.”
Ron looked at me, deciding something, and then walked over to the
cluttered desk, where he put on a pair of reading glasses. “Well, you haven’t
come to the right place, because we don’t know what really happened.” Ron
sat down in a brown leather high-backed swivel chair and slowly scanned the
papers strewn across the desk. He looked over at me, then motioned. “Please.
Come here. Maybe you can try and explain this to me.”
I slowly walked over to the desk and stood beside him.
“These were taken by the crime-scene photographer I called in,” I heard
Ronald say as I looked down at the desk. He picked up a stack of photos,
eight-by-tens.
“A crime-scene photographer?” I asked quietly, suddenly filled with
dread.
The first thing I saw was a body, carefully positioned, lying by the pool
on a sheet, drowned, naked, the penis shrunken into nothingness. Matt’s head
wasn’t in any of the photos Ronald Kellner was showing me—the first photos
I saw had all been taken below the neck—but I recognized every inch of this
body, every place I had licked and kissed and inhaled. There were a number
of photos shot from different angles documenting the bruises Mrs. Kellner
had mentioned, as if Matt had been pummeled by someone or something—
they were lightly purple and immediately noticeable. There was a photo of
Matt on his stomach in which the bruises continued along his lower and
upper back, and there were two on his muscled ass. I couldn’t help but
automatically think I had been in that ass—my cock, my tongue, my fingers
—and I had to resist any notions of arousal it inspired, a kind of necrophiliac
lust that shocked me with its suddenness. There was a photo of Matt’s left
arm gashed open, the wound wide and pink, deep enough so you could see
muscle and sinew. And then Ron showed me another photo. This one was of
Matt’s head. He looked peaceful, his eyes closed as if he was sleeping and I
could almost detect a smile in the way his lips slightly arched up. But one
side of the face was purpled with bruises and there was a large wound on the
left side of his forehead, another gash, skin had peeled off and you could
clearly see the white bone of his scalp.
“Do you think this happened when Matt hit his head when he fell into the
pool?” Ron asked without any emotion.
I was so horrified by what I was looking at I became paralyzed. The
pictures of Matt were so traumatic that one part of my life was now over and
I had entered into another world, where I would remain forever. There was no
going back to innocence or childhood—this moment was my official
introduction into the realm of adults and death. I swallowed and looked away,
closing my eyes. I heard Ronald shuffling papers around, and then sliding
something out of a folder. I wanted to say: I didn’t know your son but I loved
him anyway. I opened my eyes because they were tearing up. I clenched my
jaw hard to keep from crying in front of him.
“I’m supposing my son was a drug addict,” Mr. Kellner said, looking up
at me.
“No,” I murmured. “No, I don’t…It was just…pot, just weed. I…”
“So he wasn’t into acid or Quaaludes or anything like that? Pills? LSD?”
“No, no,” I murmured, shaking my head. “I never saw that. He never
mentioned it. I never saw him do anything except…smoke weed…”
“You never saw him tripping on acid, you never saw him taking any
pills?” he asked.
“No, I didn’t. He never talked about any of that.”
“Hallucinogens?” Ronald asked. “He never talked about that?”
Again, I shook my head, numbly.
“Quaaludes?”
“I never saw any Quaaludes around,” I said. “Matt never talked about…
that…”
“Well, then, how do we explain the six thousand milligrams of
methaqualone that were found in his system?” Ronald Kellner asked me. I
suddenly felt we were in a courtroom and I was on trial and Ron was a
prosecutor trying to gauge whether I was innocent or guilty.
I was totally numb but managed to ask, “What is that?”
“Quaaludes,” he said. “Six thousand milligrams of Quaalude were found
in my son’s system.”
I just kept shaking my head. There was nothing to say. The power of the
pictures had reduced me to a shell. I felt completely empty inside. I didn’t
care about anything anymore and I was so frightened I could barely move.
“I’m trying to piece together where my son was that week,” he said. “Do
you know anything?”
“Well,” I started, “didn’t they find that backpack at the parking lot?” My
voice sounded like that of a little boy.
“In Crystal Cove?” Ron asked. “You mean in Crystal Cove State Park. In
Orange County.”
“Yeah,” I said. “Didn’t they find the backpack in that parking lot, so, um,
didn’t he drive there and maybe…maybe…I don’t know…something
happened…”
“He didn’t drive anywhere,” Ronald said flatly.
“How…do you know?” I asked—the dread kept expanding.
“I spoke to my son before the weekend he disappeared,” Ronald said. “I
told him he needed to get the headlight replaced on the Datsun. I’d told him
to do this for weeks but he was always…distracted”—was the word Ronald
Kellner landed on, replacing the more obvious choice: stoned—“and he
hadn’t done it. I know the head of the Nissan dealership in Encino and so I
took it in myself and got the car serviced.” Ronald stopped and then looked
up at me. “He didn’t drive one hundred and forty miles to and from Laguna
Beach.”
“How…do you know this?” I asked quietly.
“Because when I had the car serviced I noticed what the mileage was. I
had seen what the mileage was at the dealership.” He stopped. “I noted the
mileage on that Thursday, and a week later, when the car was driven back
and parked here in the garage at the guesthouse, I checked it again.”
I just stared at the photos on the desk, listening to Ronald Kellner as if he
was telling me this while we were standing on a faraway planet.
“My son drove that car barely ten miles the week he was missing,” he
said.
I looked over at Ron as I exhaled.
“No one drove that car to Crystal Cove,” he said, confirming this
information again. “No one drove that car anywhere. Oh, maybe over the hill
and back, but no one drove that car to Crystal Cove.” There was another
silence in the office. I stared out the window onto the expanse of lawn that
led to the empty pool. Sheila Kellner was still sitting, frozen, in the gazebo. I
had nothing to say.
“There was blood all over the front seat of the Datsun and the
dashboard,” Ronald said, pointing to the photo of Matt’s arm. “This is where
they say he sliced himself open.” He paused. “A suicide attempt during a
psychotic episode, they say.”
Ron started looking through a sheaf of papers he picked up from the
desk.
“They told me my son probably took too much”—he glanced at the page
he was holding—“tetra-hydro-cannabinol,” was the word he carefully
pronounced. “Marijuana,” he clarified flatly. “They can’t find marijuana
levels in an autopsy but they assume that, because of all the drug
paraphernalia found in Matt’s backpack, this was what led him to ingest ‘a
massive amount of Lysergic acid diethylamide.’ LSD.” Ronald said this in
the same flat voice. “And then, according to them, he probably had a
psychotic break and then took the Quaaludes and fell into the pool, where he
drowned. That’s what they pieced together. That’s their official story.” I
realized the paper he was looking at was part of the autopsy report. Ronald
started to say something and then paused, unsure if he should admit what he
was going to say next. And then he did. “Also found in Matt’s stomach were
the mostly undigested contents of what had been in his aquarium, which he
apparently ingested during this supposed psychotic break.” Ronald looked
back at me as if I could somehow explain how this might have possibly
happened.
I wanted him to stop talking. I wanted to leave the room. I knew the
aquarium had been empty for weeks. I knew Matt had no idea what happened
to the fish. And then, because of what I’d just been told, I wondered if he had
placed the contents of the aquarium in another location before ingesting them
during the supposed psychotic break. But this sounded ludicrous. I didn’t
know what to say. The whole scenario had become so surreal compared to
what we originally heard and yet there was proof that this narrative had
actually happened. It was typed on the papers that Ronald Kellner was
holding. It was in the autopsy report filed by the L.A. County Department of
Medical Examiner-Coroner, their title stamped at the top of each page Ronald
held.
Ronald sighed and then said, “And he supposedly also did this.”
Ronald showed me another photo—there was a series of them. I took the
photos in my lightly trembling hand and at first I didn’t know what I was
looking at—something was hanging from the column now wrapped in the
sheet of blue plastic. It was the column you passed as you entered the pool
house. My eyes adjusted to the photo: there was some kind of animal hanging
from the column but I couldn’t tell what kind because it didn’t have a head. A
belt had secured the animal midway up the column and then someone had
crucified all four of the animal’s paws with nails so that it was splayed out
like an X. And it had been eviscerated: a pouch of intestines hung between its
legs and the bottom half of the column was darkened with blood. I started
realizing something and it was confirmed when I looked at the next photo: it
was the head of Alex placed on the edge of the pool’s shallow end. The cat’s
eyes had been gouged out and its ears sliced off and someone had pulled its
tongue so far out of its mouth that the tip was draped over the edge of the
coping. I tried to process this but my mind was shrieking with horror: I was
supposed to believe that Matt had somehow found Alex—or Alex had
reappeared—and Matt decapitated the cat and then nailed its body to a
column and placed the head at the edge of the pool and then fell, hit his head
and drowned, tripping on a psychotic break in which he ingested six thousand
milligrams of Quaaludes in a supposed suicide attempt. I had seen Matt
wasted numerous times and I knew what he was and what he wasn’t capable
of—only lightly stoned, he still couldn’t get up from the bed to grab the
remote control on his desk to change the TV channel. I’d never seen Matt on
acid but the amount of Quaaludes in his system would’ve rendered him
paralyzed if what Ronald Kellner read to me from the autopsy report was
correct—he wouldn’t have been able to move. None of this made sense.
Ronald sat in the swivel chair, his head bowed, lifting papers, adjusting his
glasses, dispassionately looking for clues, a narrative that would add up.
“You knew Matt for how long?” Ronald finally asked.
“About a year,” I mumbled, unable to stop staring at the pictures of his
dead son that sat on top of all the other papers on Ronald’s desk.
“Do you really think he would be capable of this?” Ronald looked up at
me.
“I don’t know,” I murmured. “I don’t think so.” And then: “No, I don’t.”
“I think someone struck him with something,” Ronald said quietly. “I
think he was with someone that week. I think they fed him drugs and then I
think they struck him with, I don’t know, a hammer, a hammer or something,
while he was high and then placed him in the pool.” He stopped. “And then
they did that to the cat.”
“The cat had been missing—” I started but Ronald was talking over me.
“And I think the whole thing was staged,” Ronald was saying. “By
someone Matt knew or met. And I think they drove him out to Crystal Cove.”
He paused. “Or they drove out there and dumped the backpack there.” He
paused again. “When you first walked in I thought you were Robert,” I heard
Ronald Kellner say.
“Why did you think that?” I managed to ask.
“Because he mentioned something about going over to Robert’s house
the day I got the car serviced,” he said. “That he might be hanging out with
someone named Robert. I assumed he was a friend of Matt’s.” A pause. “Do
you know Robert? Robert Mallory?”
“Yes,” I said, carefully putting the photos of Alex back on the desk. The
desk was so cluttered with files and reports it didn’t seem to matter where I
laid it. Ronald automatically turned the photo over, as if he didn’t want to be
reminded of what it depicted. “He’s a classmate of ours.”
“I know that,” Ronald said tiredly, rubbing his eyes. “I found out I have a
vague connection with his aunt’s ex-husband.”
“Does anyone know if Matt…was with Robert?” I asked. “I mean…that
week?”
Ronald looked up at me with an alarmed expression. “What do you
mean?”
“I mean…” I started carefully, “…does anyone know if Matt went to…”
I swallowed. I realized I had a headache. “If he went to see Robert.”
Ronald looked at me with an immediate disdain. “I’m not implying one
of your classmates had anything to do with this, Bret.” He landed hard on my
name. I was surprised he remembered it. “Is that what you’re implying?”
“No, no, I mean, I was just…” I trailed off. “I was wondering if maybe
he hung out with Robert that week.”
“We called Robert,” Ronald said. “We spoke to him. He was in Palm
Springs with his aunt the weekend Matt disappeared.” He looked at me
questioningly. “Didn’t you see him at school during that following week? I
really don’t know what you’re implying about Robert.”
“Nothing, nothing,” I muttered quickly.
“He told us he had never hung out with Matt,” Ronald said, still staring
at me as if I’d revealed something about myself that he distrusted. “Are you
really implying that you think Robert Mallory had anything to do with what
happened to my son? Are you serious?” He looked disgusted. And it
immediately was a reminder of Matt recoiling from me in the pool house that
Sunday afternoon. It was almost as if I was replaying a variation of that scene
with Matt’s father. But I was too numb with fear to be embarrassed.
“I think I should go,” I said, backing out of the room. “I’m sorry, I’m
really sorry about…everything.”
Ronald had already turned away from me because the phone was ringing,
and he reached for it quickly, as if awaiting information that would explain
this nightmare he’d been forced into. I kept backing out of the office until I
was in the hallway while Ronald muttered, “I don’t know,” into the phone at
evenly spaced intervals, responding to a series of questions that didn’t have
any answers. I made a decision to leave through the front door, because I
didn’t want to move through the house again and walk down the lawn and
pass the stoned woman sitting alone in the gazebo, or the covered column
where the cat had been hung, or the empty pool where a boy had supposedly
drowned during a psychotic episode, my friend, who I look back on while I
write this as my first love though I didn’t fully realize it then, in 1981. I
walked across the brick driveway to Haskell Avenue, where my car was
parked, and drove away from Matt Kellner’s house for the last time.
—
I WAS DRIVING SO CAREFULLY, so slowly, that I had to keep pulling
over on Valley Vista because other cars were blaring their horns behind me,
until I finally made it to Woodcliff and then sped up the canyon to
Mulholland in a suddenly desperate state, and back at the house I
immediately swallowed two Valiums, washing them down with a glass of
vodka I threw some ice into while Rosa was in the pantry folding clothes
she’d just pulled from the dryer, and then I took the bottle of Smirnoff with
me and, alone in my room with the door locked, started smoking Jeff
Taylor’s weed from a small yellow pipe—I wanted to obliterate myself. I
poured another glass of vodka and got wasted quickly. I called Susan, drunk
and high, and just started rambling and then hung up on her while she was in
the middle of a sentence—I have no idea what I said or what I told her or
what she asked back. There was a beat and then the phone immediately rang
and I grabbed it, knowing it would be Susan, and told her, “I’m okay, I’m
okay, I gotta go, I gotta go,” and then hung up on her again. There was a
moment of silence while I lay on the comforter in the bedroom, in my school
uniform, my shoes kicked off, imagining patterns in the smooth white ceiling
I was staring up at, and then looked over at the Elvis Costello poster on the
wall. TRUST is what it blared. I was surprised that Shingy was in my room,
but lying under the desk had become one of his preferred sleeping areas since
my mother left, and he jumped onto the bed and was sniffing and licking my
immobile face before cradling himself against me. The phone rang again. I
didn’t pick up. No one left a message—I realized it was probably Susan. I
was becoming paralyzed by the combination of vodka and weed and Valium
and when the phone rang about five minutes later I thought there was no way
I would be able to pick it up or form a sentence and it didn’t matter who it
was—the world was lost to me.
But it was Debbie, who Susan had obviously called, and I heard her
worried voice: “Bret? Are you there? Pick up. Bret? Pick up.” I found out
later that Susan had actually called the Windover Stables in Malibu and
paged Debbie and then Debbie called my number from their main office.
“Susan says something’s wrong. That you’re wasted, Bret. Pick up. Pick up
the fucking phone.” I finally reached over, panting from the effort, and
fumbled with the phone until I muttered into the receiver: “Please, please,
please, I’m fine. Just leave me alone, I’m fine.” I kept reassuring Debbie
everything was okay in my increasingly slurred voice and she kept saying
how wasted I sounded until I shouted: “I am wasted! I want to be wasted. IS
THAT FUCKING OKAY?” There was a brief silence and then she said, “You
don’t have to yell at me,” and asked, “Why the fuck are you getting wasted at
four in the afternoon?” I was becoming enraged but realized the anger
couldn’t actualize itself because of everything pumping through my system
and so I gently told her: “I’ll see you tomorrow, babe. Don’t bother coming
over. I’ll be passed out, babe. I’ll see you tomorrow.” I was seriously fading
when I hung up the phone. The need to erase the information about Matt
Kellner and what really happened to him—and the fact that no one else knew:
the photos of his naked corpse, the bruises, the slashed-open arm, the dead
cat—was immense and the alcohol and the Valium and the weed were aiding
quickly in locating an erasure of facts. I wanted to lose consciousness and I
eventually did. At one point I heard Rosa knocking on my locked door,
calling out that she was leaving for the day and that she’d see me tomorrow. I
called back a muffled “Okay” and returned to darkness.
13
WAKING UP THE NEXT MORNING at six-thirty, I realized I’d slept
through the entire night—I had moved through the trauma of the previous
afternoon and somehow survived.
Shingy was scratching on the door leading out to the backyard, and I
stumbled up from the bed still in my Buckley uniform and opened it and
watched as he scurried onto the deck. I made a decision in that moment: I
was going to pretend that everything was normal and that yesterday hadn’t
happened. I removed the uniform I’d passed out in and masturbated for the
first time in what seemed like weeks and came so hard that it blew apart any
remnants of the hangover and I felt such immense relief I was able to sit up
and clearly orient myself and create a schedule I was going to follow daily
and embody a new attitude. I looked at the near-empty bottle of Smirnoff on
the nightstand and the yellow pipe next to the bag of weed and the canister of
Valium whose contents were dwindling and something resolved within me:
fuck the fear. I was exhausted from being afraid. No more weed, no more
Valium, drinking kept to a minimum and on weekends only. I would set the
alarm and wake up to an allotted time and jack off thinking of Richard Gere
or Dennis Quaid or Hart Bochner or David Naughton or whatever movie star
was on my radar in that moment, but never Matt Kellner again or Ryan
Vaughn, and then I’d work out before school, either lift weights or swim laps
or run on the treadmill, and then I’d shower, put the uniform on, tell Rosa to
prepare something healthy for breakfast, and while waiting at the island in the
kitchen I’d scan the “Calendar” section in the Los Angeles Times and make a
list of new movies I wanted to see, their theaters and show times, and I’d
ignore any news about the Trawler. I’d drive to Buckley, get there early,
smile at everyone, kiss Debbie on the lips when I saw her in the parking lot or
waiting for me on the bench beneath the bell tower, intone the Pledge of
Allegiance and the Buckley Prayer, run laps on Gilley Field, play tennis with
Thom, read Joan Didion in the bleachers and calmly think about my novel,
eat lunch with the gang at the center table below the Pavilion, join the
conversations—no more writerly silences—and concentrate on my afternoon
classes, take better notes and ask questions, drive back to Mulholland, and
finish all reading and homework assignments before working on Less Than
Zero—maybe there would be a movie on the Z Channel I’d have time to
watch and then I’d promptly go to bed at eleven, and sleep through the night
easily because I was pushing all the useless trauma out of my mind.
I’d also be committed to focusing on another priority: I was going to
track Robert Mallory. This actually moved to the top of the list and
everything else followed, and this new discipline would clarify my days. I
was going to start paying attention to Robert and not resist him anymore: this
was number one on the schedule I was laying out. I pushed myself off the
bed, and in the bathroom washed the drying semen from my stomach and
chest and penis, and stared at my face in the mirror above the sink until I
forced a smile—I tried several on before I turned away.
—
I WAS STARVING—Rosa hadn’t arrived yet and when I walked into the
kitchen I grabbed a yogurt out of the fridge and some blueberries and
raspberries and threw them into a bowl, rummaged around the cupboard for
some almonds, tossed those in as well and ate the whole thing in a matter of
minutes while standing behind the glass door, contemplating Shingy roaming
the lawn. I looked around my room and decided to actually make the bed—
even though Rosa usually did—because I had to stay busy. I couldn’t just sit
around waiting for school to start, thinking about what actually happened to
Matt Kellner, and kept the TV on Good Morning America just to have some
noise float through the space—words and information, headlines and
interviews—because I didn’t want to hear any music that might move or
depress me or become a reminder about Matt. I wanted to stay neutral and not
only on that particular morning but all the mornings that followed until I
graduated. I was usually fairly neat anyway so there was never a lot of clutter
around but I needed something to do so I mindlessly rearranged the books on
a shelf next to my desk and then noticed an unused Gucci backpack, a gift
from my dad before my parents left for Europe that had been lying in the
corner for a month beneath the Elvis Costello poster, and decided to put all
my textbooks in it—I liked it, it looked cool, it was stylish, it represented the
new me. And then I slipped on a bathing suit and swam sixty laps in about
twenty minutes—swimming them fast and hard. When I got out of the pool
Rosa had arrived and seemed surprised, almost concerned, when I walked
through the kitchen, toweling myself off, and asked her to make me an
omelet por favor while I showered and got dressed—I almost never asked
Rosa to make me anything for breakfast and she was often knocking loudly
on my door at eight-fifteen to make sure I’d be up in time to get ready for
school. But not today: the tangible participant appeared, ready to engage with
the world and track the new boy that had entered our lives: the psychopath.
—
IN THE BATHROOM I stood in front of the mirror again and realized I
needed a haircut—my mother usually had her hairdresser, Allen Edwards, cut
mine at his salon in Encino and she always made the appointments, but I
marked down a note to find the number and call the salon myself—maybe
this week. Staring at myself, I thought it was remarkable how composed I
looked—the intensity and relief of the orgasm, the swimming of the laps,
making a new schedule, embracing a new outlook, the thought of tracking
Robert Mallory and keeping an eye on him, it all aided in this calmness. On
that morning in early October I believed it was all going to work out but there
was one small glitch: as I picked up the clothes I wore the day before I felt a
bulge in the gray slacks and found a pair of white jockey shorts in the pocket
and stared at them, mystified, as if I didn’t know where they’d come from.
And then I realized I’d taken them from the pool house on Haskell Avenue
yesterday afternoon. I breathed in and my chest tightened as I remembered
the photos Ronald Kellner showed me and I had to erase Matt completely
from my mind—and I did—but I was conflicted by this item of clothing and
instead of distracting myself by spending the time to figure out what to do
with it I simply tossed the jockey shorts into the bottom drawer of my desk,
one I rarely, if ever, opened. I now realized about Matt Kellner on that
morning: there was nothing I could do. There was nothing anyone could do.
He was gone—the photos I’d seen in Ronald Kellner’s office proved this
unequivocally. But the new schedule would offer a way to erase memory and
offer a semblance of control, which is what I really craved, and allow me to
wipe away the past. Everything was now about the future. And then I noticed
the piece of paper I’d taken from Matt’s desk at the pool house yesterday
afternoon and stared at it—the initials RM and a phone number. I forced
myself not to moan and before slipping it into my jacket I briefly flashed on:
the new attitude might be more elusive than I thought.
—
BUT ATTEMPTING THIS NEW ATTITUDE for the first time worked: it
made everything easier. I drove to Buckley that day in silence—again, I
didn’t want to hear music, songs that would remind me of Matt, or make me
feel something, and distract me from the schedule. I wanted to remain
emotionless, and climb onto that vaulted tier of numbness that Susan
Reynolds resided on. That was the plan. I waited patiently without the usual
annoyance in the line of cars on Stansbury Avenue before driving past the
Buckley gates. I parked the Mercedes in its usual space and I saw Debbie and
Susan on the bench beneath the bell tower, both of them watching me
carefully as I stepped out of my car—they were concerned about me and
didn’t know what to expect and yet this wouldn’t be an annoyance—and then
I saw Ryan and Thom standing by Ryan’s Trans Am and they waited as I
slung my new backpack over my shoulder, and neared them, happily draped
my arms around their necks and smiled widely as we walked toward the girls.
This gesture made Thom really happy—he was the human equivalent of a
golden retriever, I had realized a long time ago—and he asked, grinning,
“How you doing, buddy?” and I said, “Great, dude, everything’s great,” and
Thom said, “That’s awesome.” Ryan pretended this was all acceptable even
though I knew he was continuously flinching inside, stiffening up as the three
of us walked together, my arms around his and Thom’s shoulders. Thom was
loose, Ryan was uptight and that was okay.
When we got to the girls, who’d been silently watching us approach, I
hugged Debbie as she stood up and gave her a kiss and apologized for
yesterday afternoon’s outburst and the worried expression on her face
morphed into a smile and I took her hand—all of this right in front of Ryan
Vaughn, who, in the spirit of the new schedule, could go fuck himself, I
thought, you fucking homo—and walked with Debbie through the pathway
that led into the heart of the school, Thom and Susan behind us murmuring to
each other, Ryan following as well, until we got to the administration office
and it was almost nine and time for the first class of the day, which I shared
with Susan and Ryan, American Fiction, taught by Mr. Robbins. Debbie and
I kissed goodbye—it was ridiculous she needed this when she would be
seeing me in only forty-five minutes but I was going to supply the public
displays of affection she wanted so badly and keep my fucking mouth shut—
just do whatever she wanted, that was part of the plan, these were details in
the new attitude I’d be adhering to. I was the tangible participant once again.
Susan and Thom shared a similar kiss but Susan turned away a little too
suddenly after the kiss and Thom’s smile faltered. I caught his fleeting
confusion—it was something only I noticed, and still remember to this day
because it was about a rare thing: Thom Wright’s disappointment. I held the
door open for Ryan Vaughn, who passed me into the classroom and muttered,
“You’re ridiculous,” and I didn’t say anything back. I didn’t let it bother me
—I might have fallen in love with him but there was no way for this to
happen, to actualize itself in this particular time and place, in the atmosphere
at Buckley, in high school, in 1981, so fuck it, go with the counter-narrative.
Who cared anyway? It was all bullshit. It felt so cleansing to look at things
from this angle. I wanted to be where Susan Reynolds was. And I wanted to
write like this as well: numbness as a feeling, numbness as a motivation,
numbness as the reason to exist, numbness as ecstasy.
—
AND ROBERT Mallory was in the courtyard below the Pavilion at the midmorning assembly, looking immaculate, reading a paperback, and it all
seemed so manufactured: the dimples when he fake-smiled at someone who
passed by, the model good looks that disguised—or maybe accentuated—the
darkness, the mannequin that pretended it was human. I was standing with
Debbie, who was talking to Susan and Thom about Homecoming, while I
noticed Robert’s thick brown hair, wavy and streaked with gold, his tan, the
cleft in his chin—Thom had the same cleft, so did Ryan—and I imagined a
big cock below that slim waist because he was so fucking confident. Without
excusing myself from Debbie I headed toward Robert, who was standing
alone, and noticed a group of ninth-grade girls huddled nearby whispering
about him as if he was a movie star they’d just glimpsed at a mall, and I
pretended to walk casually around the plaza filling up with students, deciding
where to stand during the assembly, idly passing in and out of kids grouped
in clusters, when, in fact, I was heading toward Robert, who automatically
noticed me when he looked up blank-faced from his book—Rabbit, Run, by
John Updike, the current assignment in American Fiction—and then smiled
widely as I approached, but I located the worry in his eyes.
He said, “Hey, dude,” in what sounded like a practiced line reading and I
said, “Hey, dude,” back and matched his smile and he asked, “How you
doing? You doing okay?” and I said, “I’m doing great. Everything is gonna
be okay. I’m just moving along. Taking it easy.” He nodded approvingly.
“That’s rad, man, that’s the way to do it, man. Just go with the flow.”
And then I said, also nodding, “Yeah, the flow, that’s what I’m going
with, dude. It’s rad. Take it easy.”
Robert noticed I was studying him, almost peering at his perfect features
—the slightly hollowed cheeks, the lips that verged on thick, the perfect nose,
the row of white teeth visible whenever he offered a fake smile. He tried not
to seem startled.
“Yeah? Is anything wrong?” he asked, lightly concerned.
I didn’t give a fuck anymore and I asked him, “Have you ever modeled?
Or auditioned for something? Like a commercial or a movie?”
He looked at me quizzically, or pretended to, because there was
something—a madness—now whirring behind the eyes that I so easily
activated, and this gratified me. He thought there was something wrong with
my question yet didn’t know what to say.
“Have you ever wanted to be a model?” I asked him. “You look like you
could be a model. Ever done any modeling when you were in Chicago?” I
asked. “You’re a pretty good-looking guy.”
He tried not to stare at me as if I was crazy and just accept the
compliments but it was obvious that my approach disturbed him.
Before Robert could say anything the assembly began and I sensed his
relief as Dr. Croft walked to the microphone and the Pledge of Allegiance
was about to be dully intoned, and I glanced at Robert as he placed his hand
on his chest and noticed I almost decided not to—maybe I wasn’t going to
say the Pledge of Allegiance that morning, standing next to him, inhaling his
scent, cedar and sandalwood, as it drifted toward me.
But then I smiled pleasantly and looked up at the flag hanging from the
steel pole high above the hundreds of students dully intoning the pledge, and
placed my hand over my heart. He glanced at me again when the Buckley
Prayer came next and seemed mildly surprised when I hesitated to clasp my
hands and bow my head. But it was just a pause, a kind of warning, to
destabilize him, to let him know that I was perhaps as unpredictable as he
was. He had no idea that a phone number with his initials next to it was in the
pocket of the jacket I was wearing and that I had torn it from the pad a dead
boy had kept in his desk drawer and I wondered what would happen if I
brought the slip of paper out and asked Robert if it was something he
recognized, if those were his initials, if that was a number he knew, and then
innocently inquired why he had given it to Matt Kellner.
—
BOTH DR. CROFT AND SUSAN REYNOLDS offered their reminders that
Homecoming was next Saturday, and there would be a pep rally on Friday
where the Queens and Kings would be announced, and which team the
Griffins were going to be playing against in the Private School League; it
went without saying it would be a team they could easily beat—that was one
of the rules about Homecoming, and the visiting team knew this going in, and
though no one threw a game just so that the Buckley Griffins could be
declared victors, a team was agreed upon they could lightly trounce and
everyone was a good sport—the Griffins and whatever visiting team they
played (odds were it was going to be Brentwood). Susan reminded the
student body that each class could begin decorating their Homecoming floats
on Thursday starting at three o’clock on Gilley Field and juniors and seniors
would be allowed to stay as late as ten-thirty on both Thursday and Friday if
they felt more work was required.
“Escape from Buckley High” was the announced theme of the senior
float that year and it was a take on Escape from New York, the popular John
Carpenter movie released that summer, a futuristic thriller set in 1997 where
the island of Manhattan had been converted into a giant maximum-security
prison—and the senior float was going to replicate the poster’s main image:
the fallen head of the Statue of Liberty lying in the middle of Fifth Avenue. It
was a dystopian choice we thought would be funny—and since the hero,
Snake Plissken (played by Kurt Russell), wasn’t on the poster there would be
an enlarged image of Thom Wright’s scowling, lightly stubbled face
superimposed over the Statue of Liberty’s head complete with an eye patch.
We’d replicate our take on the title in blood-red lettering and rework the ad
lines promoting the movie. Instead of “1997. New York City is a walled
maximum security prison” we’d replaced 1997 with 1982, and New York
City with Buckley. And we’d keep the rest: “Breaking out is impossible.
Breaking in is insane.” This was surprisingly punk for Buckley in 1981 and
we were surprised that the administration’s unusually conservative
decorating-approval committee had accepted it. By comparison, the junior
class was playing it safe and their float was simply a replica of a box of
Junior Mints.
Saturday would start off with the football game and a parade of floats
during halftime, a mini-carnival with booths set up on the elementary-school
field on the other side of campus, and then the annual Homecoming dinner
would commence in the Pavilion, catered and with an orchestra; tickets could
be purchased at Mrs. Strohm’s desk in the administration office and there was
the reminder that seating was limited. I paid close attention to Susan as she
dully read this information almost as if she was lightly mortified by it—she
was in another world far beyond this one, floating on a cloud of numbness,
but it was different than before, something was off. And though I realized
later where this hesitancy was coming from regarding Homecoming, it
seemed odd standing in the crowded courtyard hearing her even more
resolutely unenthusiastic than she’d already become—she was taking her
alluring numbness into a new place that was tinged with what I sensed was
embarrassment.
I turned slightly to see Robert Mallory looking up at the girl behind the
microphone and I had never seen Robert as seemingly calm as he was in that
moment, staring serenely at Susan—he had transformed into another boy. He
realized at a certain point that I was gazing at him and he just blankly stared
back, almost daring me, until he finally fake-smiled and I looked away. I
couldn’t help but note—it broke through the new attitude I was adjusting to
—that no one mentioned Matt Kellner anymore and on that morning I had to
accept: this was okay. It had already happened, it was in the past, Matt was
over. This was what the new attitude demanded. But my central question was
still connected to Matt: why had Robert Mallory killed him?
—
I REALIZED I HAD unnerved Robert and I apologized to him after
assembly and said, “I’m sorry if I weirded you out.” He made a gesture, a
sympathetic shrug, and said, “You didn’t weird me out. It sounded pretty gay
but it didn’t weird me out.” And as he turned to walk toward the Pavilion,
where the boys’ locker room was located, said he’d see me up on the field.
But I skipped Phys Ed that day and went instead to the administration office
and asked one of the secretaries, Mrs. Stanley, if I could take a look at the
Buckley roster. I needed to check something, I explained, as she reached into
a drawer and handed it to me, red and with a sketch of the bell tower on its
cover. I hadn’t been able to find the roster at the house on Mulholland that
morning but it wouldn’t have been in my bedroom anyway, since I already
had the five numbers I needed memorized—Susan, Thom, Debbie, Ryan,
Matt. I wanted to compare the number I found on the piece of paper I’d taken
from the pool house with the number listed next to Robert Mallory’s Century
City address. The phone number at that residence, of course, did not match,
which is what I expected.
But not dreaded, because dread was not part of the routine anymore.
Dread was a waste of time. Dread didn’t get things done. Dread stalled you. I
might have assumed that Robert had something to do with Matt’s death—yes,
without any proof this is what the writer does: he is always hearing things
that aren’t there—but I wasn’t going to let it fill me with dread, because then
I wouldn’t be able to figure things out. And yet what was there to figure out?
I imagined someone asking me. There was no proof, there were no
connections, Robert had supposedly been in Palm Springs the weekend Matt
disappeared, or so Ronald Kellner had been told, and I had seen Robert at
school various times during that week, so what the fuck were you thinking,
Bret? I could imagine someone gently reprimanding me.
I sat downstairs in the near-empty library and tried answering two essay
questions for European History and then “studied” for my retake of the SATs
in late October; my combined score was barely 1100 even though a tutor had
come over to the house on Mulholland twice a week for a month before I
took the exam—and that score, of course, minimized the number of colleges I
could get into, but I never cared what college I got into and I had never been
particularly invested in what my SAT scores were: I just wanted out of
Buckley, I wanted out of the house on Mulholland, I wanted to get away from
Thom and Susan, I wanted out of Los Angeles, the sprawl of which allowed a
dozen serial killers to coexist, a place where the Trawler thrived and
disappeared girls. But the new attitude I embraced that morning made me
realize I should care about the SATs and what my college options were
because if I wanted to get out and not end up at USC (the University of
Southern California, often jokingly referred to as the University of Spoiled
Children)—which at the time seemed like my one decent option and even
then only because of my father’s connections—I had to pull myself together
and care more.
—
I REMEMBER very little about the rest of that day except certain and
specific images when I met the group for lunch. Instead of extending the
drama about Matt and sharing the reality surrounding his death, which I so
easily could have done, eagerly giving them the horrible information I
discovered in Ronald Kellner’s office, I just went with the flow of
conversation, which was all about Homecoming, and it was hard to follow
because there were few things I cared less about at Buckley than
Homecoming, and I struggled to keep up with the conversation and happily
participate in it—instead offering the writer’s cynical perspective on the
event and making everyone laugh. This was part of my job, I realized—
making fun of Buckley—and it was a character I was expected to sometimes
play and the group always seemed to enjoy it: I made fun of stuff and people
laughed. Even Robert Mallory threw his head back and laughed when I said
something especially scathing about one of the gay art teachers, a flamer, but
the one thing I remember most intensely is how Susan and Robert barely
interacted with each other at the center table we were all sitting at in the
shadow of the Pavilion and it wasn’t just because Thom and Jeff and Ryan
commanded the conversation and kept deciding on which direction it would
go, but it was as if a genuine shyness had enveloped both Susan and Robert,
and they seemed muted compared to the rest of the group. But they didn’t
ignore the conversation and Robert asked perfunctory questions about what
the usual Buckley Homecoming was like—it seemed so lavish and nothing
like what he had experienced at Roycemore—and sometimes Susan answered
one or two of his inquiries, but more often Thom would explain what the day
entailed, finally adding that there was an after party at someone’s house—this
year Anthony Matthews’s, because he lived closest to the school—and
“expect to get wasted, dude,” Thom promised, while Debbie pushed into me
and I suggestively placed a hand on her bare thigh: I could feel goose bumps
rising across her flesh while I tried not to stare at Ryan.
—
THE THING THAT HAUNTS ME from the day I embraced the new Bret
was, I remembered Thom and Ryan had football practice after school and
Debbie had driven to the Windover Stables and I asked Susan if she wanted
to head into Westwood and see a movie—there was one that had opened at
the Plaza, co-written by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, an adaptation
of Dunne’s bestseller True Confessions starring Robert De Niro—but Susan
demurred and said she didn’t want to see that movie. I then suggested a Ryan
O’Neal comedy at the Mann triplex or Mommie Dearest at the Village—I had
made a list that morning with late-afternoon show times on it—but Susan
seemed vaguely withdrawn in ways I hadn’t witnessed before: the numbness
was different now, it was in a place I couldn’t locate, an area I wasn’t
allowed into. Susan said she was going to drive back to Beverly Hills and get
as much homework done as possible and she wanted to finish reading Rabbit,
Run. I immediately noted I had seen Robert Mallory reading the same
paperback at the mid-morning assembly but why had I rushed to that
connection? We were all assigned to read it—I was reading it. I automatically
made that connection and found a hidden meaning in it—Robert and Susan
reading the same book—because it had slipped through my new attitude.
Why would I care? Because: You hear things that aren’t really there…That
connection was coming from the dramatist I’d been trying to erase and I had
to let him go.
And I admitted happily, and graciously, that this sounded like the better
and more practical idea as Susan and I walked toward the parking lot
together. We hugged at her car and then I walked to mine and sat in the
450SL while Susan sat in her car. And yet she wasn’t going anywhere. The
BMW remained in the space for what seemed like twenty minutes while I
tried waiting her out but my new attitude wouldn’t allow this—I was wasting
time and I wanted to stick to the schedule. I imagined Susan was probably
listening to Icehouse, smoking a clove cigarette, thinking about Thom’s trip
back east, contemplating the party she was throwing postponed due to Matt’s
death and then Homecoming. Finally, Susan won out and I tried not to curse
when I pulled the Mercedes out of my spot and drove by her sitting alone in
the BMW and as I steered the car toward the gates leading out of Buckley I
glanced in the rearview mirror, and on cue, Robert Mallory appeared from the
afternoon shadows of the bell tower and stepped carefully off the curb, as if
he had been waiting for my departure.
—
THE NEXT MORNING I got behind the wheel of my mother’s Jaguar XJ6
and carefully pulled left into the traffic racing along Mulholland and drove to
Buckley, where I parked the car in the first available space on Stansbury
Avenue and walked up past the gates and into the entrance to the school. This
was the second day with the new attitude, the new Bret—and it had worked
the night before: I ate the quesadilla Rosa had left for me to reheat, I
completed all my homework, I swam laps, I wasn’t afraid, I tried to finish the
Updike novel but I found myself too tired and so I set the alarm and fell into
an easy sleep because I hadn’t let anything distract me. I had kept focus on
the essays and the calculus homework, which I could never make sense of,
often just zoning out on the textbook with the logarithmic spiral of the
nautilus shell on the cover—but that night I at least tried. And I typed three
double-spaced pages of the novel before I picked up Rabbit, Run, and went to
bed. The next morning I woke up before the alarm and masturbated to a
fantasy about the two stars from Gallipoli—Mel Gibson and Mark Lee—
having sex with each other, in character; few actors, I felt, were more
beautiful than Mel Gibson, and I didn’t want to think at all about Ryan
Vaughn, and definitely not Matt Kellner, but suddenly Martin Hewitt, who
had starred in Endless Love that summer, took over the fantasy and I came
hard thinking about him, briefly naked, on top of Brooke Shields, on top of
me, and I was gripping his ass, urging him on. I showered and dressed after
realizing I’d be running laps on Gilley Field that day instead of working out
in the makeshift gym next to the garage. Rosa hadn’t arrived yet and I ate a
bowl of Frosted Flakes while I watched Shingy frolic mindlessly on the lawn.
I didn’t open the Los Angeles Times that was sitting folded on the island.
On my way to the library I nodded at Miguel, who was directing traffic,
and noticed that neither Thom’s car nor Susan’s car nor Debbie’s BMW nor
Robert’s Porsche was in the parking lot and I realized that I’d arrived at
school far earlier than I planned when I looked at my watch. I walked into the
library and sat in a wood-paneled cubicle and unzipped the Gucci backpack
and read Rabbit, Run, until just before nine, when I headed to American
Fiction and saw that the class was filled. I nodded to Ryan in the front row
off to the side and then sat down next to Susan, who casually leaned over and
said “Hi.” She was so lovely in that moment that I simply stared into her face
shocked by its beauty, but she located something besides the shock and
asked, “What’s wrong?”
I shrugged and said, “Oh, y’know, everything.”
She smiled with an exquisite blankness. “Debbie was looking for you,”
she said quietly as Mr. Robbins placed his briefcase on the desk in front of
the long black chalkboard he rarely used.
“I was hiding in the library,” I whispered.
“Hiding from who?” Susan asked, amused and expectant.
I paused and then said, “Everybody.”
She sighed as the class began and I wanted to ask her what she talked to
Robert Mallory about yesterday afternoon when I drove out of the parking lot
and saw him approaching Susan’s car. But the new attitude, the new Bret,
restrained me from inquiring about this.
—
THERE WAS A FOOTBALL game that afternoon at Buckley and though I
can remember who I masturbated about on that early October day (I wrote it
down—I kept lists, a jack-off journal) I can’t remember what team the
Griffins were playing though I knew Susan would be in the stands, mildly
cheering Thom on as quarterback, and I took a chance and assumed Robert
Mallory wouldn’t be attending the game. I walked down to my mom’s Jaguar
and waited for the black Porsche to roll out of the gates and onto Stansbury
Avenue, passing a car Robert had never seen before, unlike the 450SL, which
he now completely associated me with. And the black Porsche appeared at
about three-fifteen and I didn’t repeat the same mistake I’d made when I
followed him on the first day of school. I intuited that Robert would be
heading home to Century City as he drove along Valley Vista until he hit
Sepulveda and made a left and then another left, driving up the on-ramp of
the 405 freeway, and I trailed him three to four cars behind while moving in
and out of lanes as we zoomed through the Sepulveda Pass until the Porsche
steered down an off-ramp to Santa Monica Boulevard, where we passed the
Nuart, the revival theater I haunted, and then the Porsche headed toward
Century City and the condo Robert shared with his supposed aunt.
I traveled three cars behind Robert as he turned right onto Avenue of the
Stars and passed the fountains of the ABC Entertainment Center and my
father’s offices located above the Shubert Theater, where my parents took me
to see Evita that past year (they had ended up getting into an argument in the
lobby during intermission), and after their second or third separation I’d
browse through the Brentano’s bookstore waiting for my father’s day to end,
and we’d meet for a movie at the Plitt or dinner at Harry’s Bar. Those painful
excursions with my father seemed lighthearted and innocent compared to
where I was now, I realized bleakly as I followed the Porsche past the
sweeping crescent of the Hyatt Regency Hotel and then finally arrived at the
Century Towers on the corner of Pico, the last buildings on Avenue of the
Stars, where Robert made an easy left into the driveway as the Jaguar passed
the two towers that mirrored each other, both twenty-eight stories and
overlooking the Hillcrest Country Club and the golf course at Rancho Park.
The avenue was fairly empty and I easily made a U-turn and then drove
slowly past the driveway, where Robert was now leaving the Porsche with a
valet and entering the tower closest to Pico. I thought about spending the rest
of the afternoon at the Century City Mall but I was too keyed up and that
wasn’t part of the new schedule. The French Lieutenant’s Woman had
opened at the Plitt and I was tempted to see it after driving away from the
Century Towers but the new schedule allowed movies only on weekends—
afternoons and evenings during the week were devoted to homework and
planning, swimming and sleeping, taking care of yourself so the useless dread
wouldn’t come back and haunt your dreams. Being afraid is so lame, I kept
telling myself. Being afraid is so lame and you’re not a pussy, I kept telling
myself.
—
THE NEXT MORNING I DID the same thing. I drove my mother’s Jaguar to
Stansbury and found a parking space on the street. I followed Robert again
that afternoon—he left at the same time and drove across the same route—
always two or three cars behind: Valley Vista to the 405, through the
Sepulveda Pass, the off-ramp at Santa Monica Boulevard, the right turn at
Avenue of the Stars, and then I’d slow down as he made the left through the
gates of the Century Towers, where he pulled the Porsche up to the valet. I
made the same U-turn from the day before and watched again as Robert
walked past the fountain and into the building he’d entered yesterday, while
never noticing the Jaguar pulling past the gates. Everything Robert did
seemed perfectly normal—boring even—and yet I hesitated as I looked for a
place to park so I could wait and see if Robert was coming out again, if he
had changed out of his uniform into something more casual and would maybe
drive over to the Century City Mall and prowl the pathways, looking for girls
from Beverly High. But I had a new schedule and I was adjusting myself to
it. I realized I was becoming addicted to following Robert Mallory after
school. He apparently had no clue that someone was tailing him. He never
seemed to notice or gave any indication that he knew one of his classmates in
a sea-foam-green Jaguar XJ6 was following him from Buckley to Century
City, and this excited me.
—
THE NEXT DAY I parked the Jaguar on Stansbury again and then walked
through the gates as I had the previous two mornings. I was early—per my
new schedule—and headed straight for the library, where I sat in the same
wooden cubicle and finished Rabbit, Run, nonplussed, not really caring one
way or another about it. I realized that what I really cared about the last three
days was: waiting. I was waiting to follow Robert Mallory again. As the day
crept by I was waiting for three o’clock. Because I wasn’t participating with
the “real” world of Buckley as myself, I don’t remember a lot of what
happened: I just played a part that seemed to make Thom and Debbie happy,
and it relaxed Robert—it didn’t affect Susan because seemingly nothing now
did. And, of course, Ryan knew all about the act because he was playing it,
too, and there were a few times where we acted our parts with each other,
especially if other people were around—at lunch or hanging out in the
minutes before one of the three classes we shared started. Sometimes an
uneasiness appeared within the pantomime—a kind of stage fright—but you
could work through it if you just smiled passively and continued enacting the
nice and trustworthy boyfriend, the best bud, the platonic relationship, the
denial of lust.
—
I LEFT SCHOOL hurriedly after the last class. Debbie had already headed
for the Windover Stables in Malibu, and there was another football game, so
Susan wouldn’t be available to anyone. I lowered myself behind the steering
wheel of the Jaguar waiting for the black Porsche to glide past and hiding
until I felt the moment to pull away from the curb and follow Robert to
Valley Vista, where he made the same right turn as the previous two days and
where I would follow him on the same route to Sepulveda. But on that day
Robert didn’t stay on Valley Vista—he made a left onto Beverly Glen instead
of a right, which was difficult to maneuver since traffic was continually
flowing in both directions during the late afternoon. But the Porsche made the
turn aggressively with almost no concern for the drivers on Beverly Glen,
who braked abruptly and blared their horns as the Porsche interrupted the
flow of traffic. And it took me about a minute to make the same left and I
pressed hard on the accelerator, revving the car, pushing the Jaguar to catch
up with Robert as I curved up the hillside. When the Porsche came into sight
about nine cars ahead of mine, where Mulholland interrupted Beverly Glen
and the stoplight there, the relief overwhelmed me to a point I found
embarrassing. And then I was momentarily horrified by the thought that
Robert was heading to my house but the taillight on the Porsche was
blinking, indicating he was making a left, in the direction away from the
empty house on Mulholland.
—
I WAS ABLE TO make the left along with three other cars behind me, and
stayed far enough away from the Porsche so that Robert wouldn’t suspect
someone was following him. I watched through the windshield as the Porsche
turned off Mulholland and onto Benedict Canyon and then I had to slow
down when only one car was between us. As we maneuvered down the
canyon I wondered if this was simply a new route to Century City or if
Robert was going to visit someone but I couldn’t imagine it being anybody
we knew. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, like an anxiety attack, the dread
returned, taking over any curiosity I was tinged with, because I realized I
shouldn’t be doing this—tracking a classmate—and I was failing to reassure
myself that Robert Mallory was dangerous and capable of ruining everything
and what I was doing had been justified. I only caught flashes of the black
Porsche curving down the winding road, until it straightened out as the
canyon flattened. I was the only car traveling behind the Porsche—the car
behind him and in front of mine had made a left into the gated community of
Wallingford Estates—and I kept my distance as the Porsche slowed and then
swerved left about six houses up from the stoplight at Hutton.
I pulled over to the side of the road and waited for five minutes, then
carefully drove past the place Robert had pulled into. He had parked the
Porsche in the stone driveway of a two-story house pushed deep away from
the canyon road and there were no other cars visible in the driveway except
his—and that’s all I quickly glimpsed as I drove to Hutton, which was the
only stoplight on Benedict Canyon until you hit the flats of Beverly Hills.
Instead of turning left onto Hutton and heading back home, I made a U-turn
and drove toward the house and braked slowly, parked about five houses up
and waited, glancing into the rearview mirror. The stereo was off and when I
switched it on the Eagles blared—what my mother had been listening to
before leaving for Europe. And I quickly turned the sound down, waiting.
Robert was only at the house for about ten minutes before the Porsche pulled
out of the driveway and swerved left onto Benedict Canyon, speeding away
in the opposite direction from where the Jaguar was parked. I had no desire to
follow Robert any longer that afternoon.
—
I MADE ANOTHER U-turn and drove toward the house and, lightly
electrified with adrenaline, steered up the driveway and past the wrought-iron
gates, which had been pushed open, and where a mud-streaked WARNING: NO
TRESPASSING sign, in red letters, hung crookedly. The driveway was gravel
until it smoothed out into the curved entranceway made of stone. The house
was white with green shutters, traditional and anonymous, probably built in
the late 1960s or early 1970s; it was somewhat featureless—the second story
was crested with a sloping rooftop adorned with gray shingles and there was
an arched entryway that led to a white door with green trim and a squared bay
window and the house was shaded by oaks and sycamores and appeared to be
empty, the canyon hillside rising behind it. I debated exiting the car but the
compulsion was too strong and so I parked the Jaguar and stepped out. It was
eerily quiet and from where I stood I noticed that a line of trees actually hid
most of the house from the canyon road. I was breathing too hard and
realized there was no way I could last here longer than a minute—I was
keyed up and exhausted. Sweat caused the white button-down shirt to stick
against my back.
I quickly moved toward the bay window but it was curtained and when I
tried the front door it was locked—this was all happening so fast that I didn’t
even process what I was looking for or what I’d expected to find. I hurriedly
moved around the side of the house and into the backyard, where there was a
tennis court with a sagging net, strewn with leaves, and an empty pool—it
reminded me of Haskell Avenue except this one was half filled with brackish
water. I scanned an ancient red brick patio situated above the pool and
overlooking the tennis court, confirming there was nothing that suggested
anyone was living in the house. I looked up to the second story and all of the
windows were shaded. Everything was shadowed by the steeply rising
hillside behind the house and I imagined there were only a few hours where
the sun could hit the pool and the tennis court, otherwise the light was
blocked out everywhere by the hillside and the towering sycamores, and it
was so silent.
—
AND THEN I felt it: there was a presence, someone on the hillside, hidden,
watching me. I stood still, imagining what the presence, the thing, wanted
from me as it kept staring so intently from its secret vantage point. I imagined
it was breathing heavily, drooling, as it stared at me through a pair of
binoculars it held in gnarled hands tipped with yellowed talons. It was
someone from the Riders of the Afterlife, it was the Trawler, it was the ghost
of Matt Kellner. And then I heard a rustling on the hillside as if the thing was
making its way downward to where I stood beside the dilapidated tennis
court. The presence forced me to quickly leave the backyard. But as I rushed
to my car I stopped, bolted by a sentence someone had said to me, and
breathed in, trying to calm myself. I took another step, then stopped,
confused, and waited a moment before regaining my composure and walking
back to the Jaguar.
The dread I’d been trying to avoid had returned and even though I hadn’t
witnessed anything ominous somehow my mind told me that I had. And this
feeling was enveloping the world because of one thing Ronald Kellner said
about Matt’s Datsun. This was why the dread returned with a sickening
intensity, the dread I’d been ignoring as the tangible participant, the new
Bret. I suddenly believed the house I was standing in front of was the house
where the phone number that Matt Kellner had written on a notepad and that
I found in his desk was located somewhere inside. And my mind raced
toward: the mileage on the Datsun. Oh, maybe over the hill and back, Ronald
Kellner said, but no one drove that car to Crystal Cove. I convinced myself,
in that moment, trembling next to the Jaguar, that this house was where Matt
Kellner had disappeared into during the week before he died. And maybe this
is where he had been kept. I tried to calm myself with the usual mantra—you
hear things that aren’t really there—but this time the signal was too strong to
ignore, because it was pulsing and sending out shivery waves of panic, and I
was drawn to them, like a zombie.
14
ON GILLEY FIELD it was still warm out at 10:00 p.m. on the Thursday
before Homecoming and we were having problems and only twelve of us
stood around the half-finished float. Most of the high school had come up at
three o’clock that afternoon and the seniors were the only class left on the
field—everyone else had gone home—because we’d hit a snag and now time
was running out and Devo’s “Beautiful World” sounded throughout the
hushed air and Angelo was soon going to come up and usher everyone off the
field and Jon Yates was muttering that we had thirty minutes left and we all
knew that we’d be here tomorrow night as well, reconfiguring the float,
because it just wasn’t working. We had become overly ambitious with our
“Escape from Buckley High” design and though the Statue of Liberty’s head,
painted a muddy green with the spikes done up as gelled hair (punk-style),
looked good, we were having trouble with the rest of the float, especially the
street the head was lying on, as well as the houses we built from plywood and
wallboard imitating a facsimile of Stansbury Avenue complete with palm
trees, and hanging above this a banner announcing the title of the float in the
exact same lettering as on the poster for Escape from New York. Something
was off: you couldn’t tell it was Stansbury Avenue and the giant black-andwhite photo of Thom Wright’s head pasted over the statue’s face complete
with Snake Plissken’s eye patch and the stubble we’d drawn on it with Magic
Marker wasn’t recognizable as Thom—this could have been anyone.
—
THE FLOAT WAS getting too complicated—we were over-scaling it. Above
the statue’s head, ESCAPE FROM BUCKLEY HIGH didn’t fit within the banner we’d
created and “HIGH” had to be removed. Someone suggested maybe sparkling
the entire float with glitter and things were looking bleak and the flatbed
truck the senior class had chipped in to rent was parked at one end of the vast
green lawn by the bleachers and the tagline that would run across the side of
the float just wasn’t coming through—Tracy Goldman stood at the top of the
stands, which were going to be packed with roughly five hundred people on
Saturday, and couldn’t make out what the words said, so we went back to the
pile of red cardboard and started cutting out bigger letters, a tedious job. To
make it legible for people in the stands we had to lose the word “MAXIMUM”
and instead the tagline would read 1982: BUCKLEY IS A WALLED SECURITY PRISON
and then beneath that BREAKING OUT IS IMPOSSIBLE. BREAKING IN IS INSANE. and
we had to remove the “IS” in both sentences to make the tagline fit, using
colons. Those of us who stayed were still in our uniforms and became hungry
quickly when it all looked hopeless and Doug Furth and Anthony Matthews
drove down to Barone’s, an old-school Italian restaurant on Ventura
Boulevard, and brought back four large pizzas sometime around eight and
there was a cooler filled with Cokes and Tabs and 7Ups nestled in melting ice
by the tennis courts to help fortify us. The hillsides surrounding the partially
lit field were darkened, with only the glow from houses situated within the
forested canyon and the headlights of an occasional car cruising up Beverly
Glen. The smell of weed came from Kyle Colson and David O’Shea standing
near the bleachers—another sign that the float was a mess: they’d given up
and gotten high. Jon Yates, who had meticulously sketched the float with
Doug Furth, kept walking around it, clutching his drawings and staring at the
measurements in quiet disbelief: the reality wasn’t matching up to his
designs. And then Jon had a mini-breakdown when someone asked if Escape
from New York had even been popular enough to warrant such an elaborate
re-creation of the poster.
—
BUT PEOPLE KEPT diligently working: Jeff Taylor was standing on a
stepladder next to Robert Mallory, affixing green tassels on the cardboard
trunks of trees to resemble palm fronds, as Doug Furth kept busily walking
around the float, constantly making new suggestions. We were going to have
to move the statue’s head up to the front of the float to make it more visible
or else scale back one particular side of Stansbury Avenue, because the head
was being hidden—endless conversations ensued between Doug and Jon, and
ultimately one side of Stansbury Avenue was removed so the statue’s head
could be plainly seen and there was a pathetic relief palpable among my
classmates that made me just want to go home even though it was Robert
Mallory’s presence that forced me to stay—I’d thought about following him
that night once we both drove out of the parking lot but knew I probably
wouldn’t, because I was exhausted and tinged with disgust. That some of my
classmates seemed to care more about the float than the death of one of their
own was what bothered me the most: Matt Kellner might have never come up
to Gilley Field to decorate the Homecoming float, so it’s not as if his
presence was missed, but the fact that no one talked about him anymore was
disturbing—just two or three busy days of shock and then a few Mr. Bill
jokes and now nothing: he was completely forgotten by mid-October. This
hardened something in me as I stapled the new and bigger red cardboard
letters beneath the main bulk of the float and I suddenly thought
Homecoming was so dumb and this float was just one half-turn around an
oval track. What were we doing? Why were we wasting our time? I was
ostensibly there because Thom and Susan wanted me to help and I’d
demurred—the novel was always a good excuse—but once I found out that
Robert Mallory would be decorating the float as well I changed my mind.
The juniors had finished their float hours earlier and the white Junior Mints
box glowed with white and pine-green tassels lightly taunting us across the
field with its Warholian simplicity.
—
DEBBIE SHOWED UP late, having spent the afternoon at the Windover
Stables riding Spirit, training for the charity equestrian event, and when she
arrived on Gilley Field kissed me hungrily with her tongue and I pulled away
too quickly, but Ryan Vaughn had already left hours ago. As co-captain of
the football team he had to make an appearance and he also had an excuse to
leave early and he really hadn’t helped out: he stapled a couple of boxes
together but really just stood around and watched the unraveling proceedings,
amused, then split, promising he’d be there tomorrow night if the float wasn’t
finished, and I realized he never would’ve cared if he had seen the French
kiss with Debbie Schaffer—he’d probably just feel sorry for me. Debbie
noticed my reticence but didn’t say anything, preferring to ignore it, just
stayed near me as she kept stapling the red cardboard letters I was handing
her to the bottom of the float spelling “BREAKING OUT: IMPOSSIBLE. BREAKING IN:
INSANE.” while Doug was worriedly trying to figure how to improve
Stansbury Avenue with Jon.
But I was actually distracted by something that had nothing to do with
the senior float or Homecoming or the absence of Matt: a call from Steven
Reinhardt that morning set up a meeting with Terry Schaffer to talk about the
script Terry wanted me to write on Sunday at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly
Hills Hotel; it had ended with a reminder not to tell Debbie and I eagerly
confirmed that I wouldn’t and that I’d meet Terry there at four o’clock. I
occasionally glanced over at Debbie and realized she had no idea I’d already
met her father for lunch, when he’d become openly flirtatious, and that I was
prepared for the same behavior when having drinks with him in the Polo
Lounge on Sunday, and then I stared up at the hills listening for coyotes but
the Devo cassette coming out of the boom box was the only soundtrack.
What was the Trawler doing tonight? I wondered, infusing myself with a
useless shiver of dread, a feeling that occurred whenever I looked over at
Robert Mallory, whose mad green eyes were fixed intently on the cardboard
palm tree he was busily decorating.
—
AT ONE POINT I realized neither Thom nor Susan was helping with the
float and that they were standing across the empty field under a stadium light,
just the two of them, and Thom was gesturing while Susan stood there and
listened—she wasn’t saying anything, she was just staring at him. Thom was
finally rendered helpless because of Susan’s numb neutrality and whatever
anger was emanating from him seemed pleading and confused—he was
frustrated and had become enraged by her passivity. Seen from the distance
of our vantage point, Susan was coy and elusive, her arms crossed, listening
to whatever Thom was saying, but her patience was increasingly frayed—we
could tell as she kept shifting her stance. Thom was visibly upset, though we
couldn’t hear what he was talking about—we could hear a voice but not the
words. No one knew what they could possibly be fighting over but that small
sense of dread started building within me again and I started making my own
connections, even though I didn’t know the real reason for Thom’s anger. I
looked over at Robert Mallory standing on a stepladder, holding a wreath of
green tassels—he was the only one of us who wasn’t looking over at where
Thom and Susan stood, almost as if he pretended it wasn’t happening or, I
thought darkly, knew exactly why it was happening. Thom kept gesturing and
Susan’s arms remained crossed against her chest defensively. And then we
heard her. “Tell me, Thom,” she suddenly shouted, loud enough for us to hear
across the field. “How does this matter? What does it fucking matter?”
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Thom shouted back. “What the fuck
is wrong with you?”
“Why does it matter?” she shouted at him.
“It matters because I love you,” he shouted back, red-faced.
“That’s not it!” she shouted. “That’s not what I’m talking about!”
“It would look fucking complicated if you weren’t with me!” Thom
shouted. “How about that? It would look too fucking weird if you weren’t
with me!”
As Susan started stalking away Thom grabbed her arm and whirled her
around. And then: she slapped his face.
Everyone on the float watching this altercation gasped. You could hear it
from where we were: the palm of Susan’s hand making contact with Thom’s
jaw. The slap stunned Thom so badly that he automatically let go of Susan’s
arm and watched, humbled, as she made her way across the field, moving
through the patches of darkened lawn, in and out of the stadium lights, until
she got to the float and walked past us to the restrooms by the tennis court.
You couldn’t overestimate the shock of this moment—the ten of us
standing by the float who had watched this fight and the subsequent slap went
silent, and then turned away embarrassed as Susan walked by us without
saying anything—she was scowling, muttering to herself. I looked at Debbie,
who didn’t say a word. And I realized that she had this wary expression on
her face, as if she knew something that no one else did—she was the only one
of us who didn’t seem shocked. Even Robert Mallory’s eyes were widened
with surprise. No one had ever seen Thom and Susan get into a fight, and it
was something seismic, a revelation, an explosion, a rift that split the
calmness of Buckley and its traditions raggedly open: there was never any
hint of tension between them, they both seemed so easygoing, so cool, so
blessed with a general good-naturedness. I knew Susan could be brittle and
sarcastic and see through everything, yet she always kept it together, and I
also knew that Thom had been sufficiently wounded by his parents’ divorce
that he saw the world from a more jaded angle than he had before the
separation, but he rarely showed it and only privately, never in public. This
rising tension between Susan and Thom had happened gradually and so it
was something that no one had ever noticed; it had taken two years for it to
play out on Gilley Field that night. It was as if she had finally arrived at that
place through her relationship with Thom where she now resided in a
completely different world and was ready to blithely leave him somewhere
behind. I thought of the Icehouse song and how I always knew it sounded like
an omen. But that night on Gilley Field the omen was confirmed; the omen
had become actualized.
—
ROBERT MALLORY jumped off the stepladder and jogged across the field
to where Thom stood alone, head down. Robert placed a hand on Thom’s
shoulder and Thom just slowly nodded after Robert said something. Debbie
and I left the float to find Susan—everyone murmuring behind us as I
followed Debbie to the girls’ restroom. Susan was leaning against a sink,
smoking a clove cigarette, and though her hand was lightly shaking her face
was blank—the neutrality and numbness had returned after that flash of
anger. The girls’ bathroom was softly illuminated with a dim fluorescent light
and I was surprised how large the space was—there were at least ten stalls
with their own corresponding sinks and mirrors. I caught my reflection in one
and turned away, disturbed by how frightened I looked.
“I can’t do it,” Susan was muttering. “I won’t do it.”
Debbie just stood there not saying anything, as if she expected this.
“Do what?” I asked, completely confused.
“Homecoming Queen,” Susan said evenly. “Sit in that stupid car and
wave for three minutes as we crawl by the bleachers.” She moved the
cigarette to her lips: inhaled, exhaled. “It’s so stupid. I won’t do it. I told
Thom. I told him all week. I told him I don’t want to be Homecoming Queen
this year. Last year was fine. But I don’t want to do it this year and I’m not
going to do it this year.”
I just stared at her. “But you’re going to win tomorrow.”
She didn’t look at me when she asked, “Win?” She smiled ruefully to
herself. “Win? What am I going to win, Bret?”
Debbie wasn’t saying anything. She just stared at Susan.
“I told you you could take my place,” Susan said to Debbie. “Why don’t
you just take my place? You’re probably coming in second anyway.”
I realized this was true: Debbie would come in second place, though
we’d never know. There was no short list for Homecoming King and Queen
and the secretaries in the administration building privately tallied the ballots,
because the school didn’t want anybody’s feelings hurt. And I also realized
with a humbling clarity that even though Debbie Schaffer would come in
second place for Homecoming Queen, I probably wouldn’t rank in the top
five for King. I was popular because of my connection to Debbie and Thom
and Susan but this didn’t mean I was well liked enough to be anywhere near
this particular coronation.
“I don’t want to take your place—” Debbie started.
“Jesus, Debbie,” Susan muttered.
“I told you that, Susan—”
“I’ll just tell them that I can’t make it to Homecoming this year,” Susan
said over her. “I’ll just make up an excuse—”
“Oh, don’t be ridiculous,” Debbie said. “Don’t do this—”
“And you can be Homecoming Queen—you’ll probably come in second
place,” Susan said again, repeating this as if it was some desperate truth that
would change Debbie’s mind.
“Susan, you have got to get real and calm the fuck down,” Debbie said
harshly, and then, “Do you have anything to take? Because you’re acting
crazy.”
“What’s so crazy about the way I’m acting?” Susan asked, glaring at
Debbie.
“There’s the game, there’s the parade, there’s the dinner, and there’s
Anthony’s party.” Debbie was listing these events as if they were an
inevitability Susan simply had to partake in.
“What are you saying?” Susan asked, daring Debbie to admit something
private, as if I wasn’t standing in the restroom next to them. “What does any
of that mean?”
And then I suddenly got angry. “It’s only one more year, Susan, right?” I
actually spat this out at her. “Where did that attitude disappear to? You told
me it’s only one more year. Why don’t you stop being such a bitch to Thom
and suck it up like everyone else does and just do Homecoming. I mean,
Jesus, how hard can it be, sitting in a fucking float?”
Susan looked at me hard. “When I said that, I was referring to you, Bret,
and your situation.” She inhaled on the cigarette and then exhaled. “I was
referring to you. Not me. Not us. But you.” She said this with a casualness
that was still pointed and direct.
I was so deflated by this response that I just wanted to limp out of the
restroom.
“Look, let’s be diplomatic about this,” Debbie was saying.
“I’m sick of what Thom wants!” Susan suddenly screamed. “I’m so sick
of it!”
Debbie and I backed off—we actually physically moved away from her.
I had never seen Susan as frustrated and angry as she was on that night in
October. There was obviously a secret narrative unfolding that I knew
nothing about—something that I was left out of, something that was
supposedly none of my business, something that was arousing this rage
within her.
“I didn’t want my name to be eligible,” Susan was saying in a rush, “and
I told Thom that maybe we should let someone else be King and Queen, let
Jeff and Tracy or Jeff and Debbie, or whoever. It’s so stupid, I argued. The
whole thing is so stupid.” She paused. “He didn’t get it. He didn’t understand
how dumb it all is. I just told him: Let someone else have a chance. Who
gives a fuck?”
If I look back I would have married Thom Wright. He seemed to be the
perfect guy—genuinely intelligent, world-weary but optimistic, just damaged
enough to be interesting, beautiful and athletic, so nice, so hot, his face, his
body, his kindness—but I realized in that moment how someone could tire of
him over the course of two years and I was shocked that this had so obviously
happened to Susan. How could anyone not want to keep having sex with
Thom Wright, to bask in his concern, to be in his presence daily, to have him
love you unconditionally? I realized on that night this might easily happen—
that Thom Wright’s charms could wear off. That someone else could replace
him. And then I thought of Robert Mallory. I was suddenly dizzy, because
everything was going to get ruined. Thom was going to get hurt. Robert was
going to get what he wanted. I was going to get nothing.
“And then he got desperate and he said, Okay, I get it, but let’s just go
through the motions—I’m the fucking quarterback, he said, he actually said,
‘I’m the captain of the football team and you’re my girlfriend and you don’t
think it’s going to look strange if we win and you don’t do it?’ And then I
said I don’t care how it looks! That’s the problem, I told him. You care. I
don’t. And he just couldn’t really understand this, or he could but said we had
to do it anyway.” The hand holding the slow-burning cigarette was still
lightly shaking but her voice softened. “I know that when this is announced
tomorrow at assembly it’s going to be my name and his and I’m not going to
do it—I’ll give it to someone else.” She paused, glanced quickly at both
Debbie and myself with a slight desperation. “We won’t make a big deal
about it. I’ll come up with an excuse. My grandmother is sick or—”
“Baby,” Debbie interrupted softly, “there’s no reason to cause this kind
of drama right now. You know that. You know how it works.”
“The fact that I would be causing drama because I don’t want to be
Homecoming Queen is indicative of something, Debbie, don’t you think?”
Susan asked with venom in her voice.
Debbie just shrugged and stared at Susan. “No, not really. I don’t. I don’t
think it’s indicative of anything.”
Silence fell across the restroom. I didn’t know what I was doing there
with two girls who obviously knew something that they thought I didn’t have
a clue about and that was tied to Robert Mallory and being kept from me. I
wasn’t the gay best friend you could confide everything to for Susan and
Debbie, and yet in reality I actually was, but they didn’t know this. And I
might have been exactly that if I’d played things differently or if we were in
another world. Here, in this situation, in the confines of Buckley, I was, in so
many ways, an impostor.
“Do you really want to be standing on that hideous float waving to the
crowd?” Susan asked Debbie. “Do you really want to do that?”
“No, I don’t,” Debbie said calmly. “But I’m not in your position. And,
I’m afraid, you’re going to have to do it—”
“Fuck off,” Susan muttered.
“No, I’m serious.” Debbie glanced at me for some reason and then back
at Susan before admitting, “Look, I get it. I know what’s going on but—”
This startled me and I blurted out, “What’s going on?” And then in a
high voice asked accusingly, “Is there something going on that I don’t know
about?”
Debbie rolled her eyes and made a gesture. “Bret, just, y’know…” She
trailed off, concentrating on Susan, expecting me to excuse myself. I realized
again: they knew something that they thought I didn’t know.
“Of course, it’s your decision, it’s your life, it’s whatever,” Debbie was
saying. “But at this point you have to play it a certain way. I’m sorry, babe,
you just do. It’s too late. You agreed to be student-body president because
Thom asked you to—I mean what did you expect? It’s not as if anyone held a
gun up to your head. You went along with it. You’re a couple. And now this
is happening. It’s really happening and you’re going to have to do it.”
Susan stared at Debbie as if I was invisible.
“Do you want me to be happy?” Susan asked her.
Debbie sighed and cocked her head. “Don’t be so dramatic. It’s dumb.”
I was utterly lost standing there, listening to the two girls having this
coded conversation in front of me.
“And you shouldn’t have hit him,” Debbie said. “Jesus, Susan.”
“He couldn’t get it through his dumb skull—”
“Susan, stop it—”
“And he grabbed me, Debbie,” she said. “And it hurt.”
“Stop it—”
“Are you saying it didn’t hurt when he grabbed my arm?”
“What did you expect him to do?”
“Oh, fuck off—”
“Okay, look, what does it fucking matter?” Debbie asked, taking the
cigarette from Susan, inhaling and blowing a thick stream of spice-scented
smoke into the air. “I mean: what does it really matter? It just makes you look
like a bitch.” Debbie paused. “I mean, tell me. What does it matter? Just do it.
What does it matter?” She handed the cigarette back to Susan, who didn’t say
anything.
I realized one last time I shouldn’t have been there because I wasn’t
wanted in that particular moment. This was really between Susan and Debbie
and I knew they weren’t mentioning something because I was standing there.
And so I backed away, and neither one of them said anything as I quietly left
the restroom—and then I could hear their urgent muffled whispering behind
me. Finally they were allowed to speak freely because of my absence. I was
momentarily enraged that this drama superseded Matt Kellner and that more
emotion was being poured into whether Susan wanted to be Homecoming
Queen or not than his mysterious death—a death that none of them really
knew about or cared to know about. This was what sickened and exhausted
me as I left the restroom and walked back to the field.
—
THOM WAS WALKING WITH ROBERT to the float, which everyone had
started working on again, pretending nothing had happened. I could see
Angelo’s flashlight nearing us in the distance—it was ten-thirty, time to go
home, and there was no point working on the float any longer. We were
shaken and distracted because we’d witnessed something that never occurred
before: the fantasy couple revealed there were problems in the relationship,
something that had happily lasted for over two years because they were so in
love was now fractured, the slap was the proof of damage, there was now
doubt. I shuddered as I watched Robert walking closely next to Thom, their
heads bowed down, Thom listening to whatever Robert was telling him, and
occasionally Thom would nod while staring at the lawn he was crossing, both
dressed in their gray school slacks and white shirts. I just stared at Robert and
Thom and became so envious of this momentary intimacy between the two of
them that I briefly got dizzy again and then felt shame—I desired both of
them and it was never going to happen. That’s just something you’ll have to
accept, I told myself, and another thing hardened within me: the world isn’t
going to work out that way for you—get over it. I was still staring at them
when I was knocked out of my reverie, as Thom looked up, blank-faced but
also yearning, and then smiled sadly. Debbie and Susan had come out of the
restroom and were walking toward Thom and Robert standing by the float.
Susan’s face was also blank and I had no idea what she was going to say as
she walked up to him—Robert had already gently backed away from Thom.
Susan’s pragmatism kicked in, aided by Debbie, and she sincerely uttered an
apology to Thom and said, “Of course, I’ll do it,” and then Thom, his face
slightly crinkled with emotion, hugged her and lifted Susan up, before
placing her back on the lawn. He was so relieved it was almost embarrassing
—this was a different side to Thom, which I’d never seen before. I now knew
he was weak. They kissed.
Everyone surrounding the float started clapping, including Robert, and
Anthony Matthews whistled his approval. It was dumb, something out of a
movie, but I pretended to get caught up in the moment and started clapping
too, and then I noticed Debbie standing next to me, leaning in, but she wasn’t
smiling even though she was clapping as well, and her eyes weren’t fixed on
Susan and Thom—instead they were on Robert Mallory, who was smiling
broadly. The applause only lasted ten to fifteen seconds but it aided in our
overall relief—it was the representation of our relief. And then we started
leaving the field and headed down the hill to the parking lot, still lit below the
darkened campus, and a light sense of defeat hovered everywhere: we’d have
to finish the float the following afternoon, maybe even start from scratch,
Doug Furth muttered hopelessly to Jon Yates. We trailed past the science
building and I watched as Thom clasped Susan’s hand while we moved
through the darkness of Buckley. And then realized Debbie was reaching for
mine.
—
AND I WAS standing in the courtyard of the Pavilion the following morning
while the campus cheered when Thom Wright and Susan Reynolds were
announced Homecoming King and Queen of the senior class. They walked
up to the mic and thanked everyone who voted for them and Thom was
beaming obliviously, as if nothing had happened the night before, and Susan
had reverted to her dreamy and numb self, alluring as any girl at Buckley, her
cleavage clearly visible, the hem of the skirt near the top of her thighs, an
almost slutty idealization of teen-girl sexuality. I looked over at Ryan
Vaughn, who was clapping, and then got distracted by Robert Mallory, who
wasn’t clapping—he just stared at the couple behind the mic at the top of the
stairs below the shadow of the Pavilion, a gaze tinged with what I imagined
were sadness and rage. He turned to look at me and stared back, as if I was a
reminder for him to start clapping, which he then did. There was, however, a
feeling in the courtyard on that Friday morning before Homecoming that the
night before, on Gilley Field, was the beginning of the end for Thom Wright
and Susan Reynolds’s reign as Buckley’s golden couple. And only a few of
us knew that the beginning of the end had happened far earlier than that.
—
SATURDAY: I woke up and stared at the ceiling in the empty house on
Mulholland and tried to summon the spirit of the tangible participant but I
was too distracted by the meeting with Terry and depressed about the
motions that were expected of me at Buckley that day. And then I realized
that the promise of Terry Schaffer at the Polo Lounge was reason enough to
get out of bed and pretend to be excited about Homecoming and my
participation in it, on the sidelines at least—Turn it around! a voice inside my
head exclaimed—and just stay positive until the meeting on Sunday, when
Terry and I would talk about the script he wanted me to write, and perhaps
find me an agent, and then I imagined maybe Sue Mengers would represent
me as a favor to Terry and we’d celebrate by having dinner at Ma Maison
with Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne. It all seemed possible. After
jerking off and letting Shingy out, I decided, while trying on various smiles in
the bathroom mirror, that I would “happily” walk up to Gilley Field with my
girlfriend and cheer Thom Wright and Ryan Vaughn and the rest of the
Griffins and I’d say hello to friends’ parents whom I hadn’t seen in ages and
Debbie and I would stroll through the carnival, hand in hand, and buy cotton
candy, and laugh and lean in to each other while I won her a Smurf doll after
a game of darts, and I forced myself to feel: it would all be good. But my
meeting with Terry was the drug motivating the actor.
—
I REMEMBER THAT Debbie wanted to pick me up from the house on
Mulholland so we could arrive at Buckley together. I argued there was no
need for her to pick me up because I had to come back to the house on
Mulholland after the football game in order to change for the dinner in the
Pavilion. I then told her she sounded ridiculous when she suggested I bring a
change of clothes to Buckley, as she was doing so she didn’t have to drive
back to Bel Air—we could change clothes in the locker rooms—this
suggestion automatically put me into a state of annoyance. When I said that I
didn’t want to bring a suit and a pair of dress shoes to Buckley, Debbie
offered to drive me back to Mulholland after the football game and the
carnival and “help” me change into a suit for the Homecoming dinner, which
I couldn’t believe I was actually attending. “Maybe I should take my own car,
babe,” I said, when I realized she was also suggesting maybe we could fool
around before the dinner, maybe take a dip in the Jacuzzi, maybe I could go
down on her, maybe she could suck me off—she didn’t actually say this, it
was all intimation. I should just take my own car, I argued. What’s the big
deal? I asked. I’ll meet you underneath the bell tower or by the science
building and we can take the elevators up to Gilley Field together, what’s the
big deal? But my voice lacked conviction. Debbie won out. She was a force. I
caved.
—
I DIDN’T WANT Debbie coming into the house on Mulholland, so I waited
outside, wearing jeans and a Polo shirt and Topsiders, Wayfarers on, holding
a garment bag that contained a suit my dad bought for me at Jerry Magnin, a
dress shirt, and a tie from Brooks Brothers as well as a pair of penny loafers.
I kept muttering to myself: get excited, stay excited, fake the excitement,
Robert Mallory doesn’t exist, Matt Kellner didn’t die, you’re in a committed
relationship with Debbie Schaffer, Ryan Vaughn is a great dude, you love
Thom Wright and Susan Reynolds and not even the hate you sometimes feel
will ever change that.
Debbie pulled up and after I hung the garment bag in the back seat we
kissed and then she drove down Woodcliff and on Stansbury Avenue a line of
cars with VIP parking passes were slowly moving toward the open gates of
the school. Shuttles were picking people up at the empty lot across from the
Ralphs on Ventura, or you could try and find parking along Valley Vista,
which was, I noted, packed with cars lined on either side of the boulevard’s
curb. We dropped the car off with the valet set up by the bell tower and
Debbie and I slung our respective garment bags over our shoulders and
headed to the locker rooms to drop them off before going to the field.
Walking with Debbie, our sunglasses on, I suddenly felt I was a model in a
commercial, we were a couple in a travelogue who barely knew each other,
which led to the notion that I was actually being watched, that everyone was
looking at me, whether they were or not, or that someone hidden, from a
vantage point I couldn’t see, was monitoring my movements. Debbie
disappeared into the girls’ locker room and I could hear the activity
emanating from the boys’ locker room as I was about to enter and then
changed my mind and called out to Debbie if she could hang my bag with
hers—I didn’t want to see the Griffins suiting up or get distracted by them,
and I didn’t want to say hi to Thom or Ryan. Debbie took the garment bag
from me and hinted slyly that there was no one in the girls’ locker room if I
wanted to join her—the cheerleaders were already up on the field. I smiled
and went along with the innuendo, to a point, and instead suggested the game
might be starting soon. Her smile couldn’t mask the faint disappointment she
felt, or so I intimated. Maybe Debbie Schaffer actually expected me to fuck
her in the girls’ locker room before the Homecoming game or maybe this was
only what I imagined. I’m not sure I could tell anymore.
Instead of walking up the steep road to Gilley Field we waited in line at
the elevator banks and rode up in the large lift with who I suspected in the
thirty seconds it took to arrive on the field were George Vaughn and his wife,
Lois, and Ryan’s younger brother, Laine, who resembled a fourteen-year-old
miniature Ryan—this suspicion wasn’t verified until later that day, when I
saw Ryan with this family after the game. The only other parent I remember
who arrived at Homecoming that day was Thom Wright’s mother, Laurie,
who was with a good-looking guy about her age, roughly late thirties, whom
I’d never seen before, and the way they carried themselves suggested he was
more than a friend, and since I really hadn’t hung out with Thom this
semester I had no idea what was going on in his mom’s life—I usually did.
Laurie spotted Debbie and me as we took our seats in the first row of
bleachers and waved, smiling through her sunglasses, while her date was
leafing through the program, and we waved back. Liz and Terry Schaffer
were never going to show up to Homecoming, and neither were Don and
Gayle Reynolds, Susan’s parents, especially since their daughter had
probably begged them not to.
—
IT WAS in the mid-sixties and the sky was clear and blue, a mild afternoon,
the smog usually floating over the Valley only visible far away, lightly
shrouding the San Gabriel Mountains, but I became uncomfortably warm
sitting beneath the sun in the stands as the Griffins were announced and
bounding onto the field to greet the varsity team from Brentwood (they’d be
having their own Homecoming the following week) and I just sat idly next to
Debbie, who was talking to Susan and Tracy in the two seats next to hers as I
pantomimed the expected cheering. I was on the aisle—I had requested this
to Debbie when she bought the tickets, warning her I wouldn’t go if I didn’t
have an aisle seat. Two yearbook photographers were covering the stands,
while Mr. Richards, the photography teacher, was taking pictures of the
action on the field, which I scanned uselessly—I knew no one in the
marching band, I didn’t really know any of the cheerleaders from the junior
and senior classes, meaning I hadn’t been to any of the games that semester,
so I was surprised, I guess, to see that Karen Landis and Rita Lee and Katie
Harris were all jumping around flinging red-and-white pom-poms into the air.
One of the yearbook photographers took a photo of Susan and Tracy and
Debbie squeezing in to each other smiling while I shifted away in my seat,
disappearing myself, and then everything passed quickly as I watched the
figures on the field scrambling after each other while I started to outline the
pitch I was going to offer Terry Schaffer the following afternoon at the
Beverly Hills Hotel, sitting with him in a large green booth, and I’d be
wearing a blazer (it was required in the Polo Lounge) and explaining what I
had in mind—a boy, his friends, young people in L.A., sexy, a little bi, drugs,
someone is killed, there’s a chase, violence and bloodshed, a mystery the boy
solves or maybe not, I preferred the downer ending but we could make it
upbeat as well, I’d offer, we could negotiate that.
—
I WAS JOLTED BACK into paying attention when halftime was announced.
Susan was no longer in her seat and the first float appeared on the track—it
was a miniature bell tower the seventh-graders had built, and there were two
students, a boy and a girl, both blond and very cute, sitting on a replica of the
bench beneath the bell tower and waving. And then I felt a curdling as the
second float passed and there was sustained applause and cheering for a
massive autumn leaf festooned with a thousand strands of red and orange and
yellow tissues slowly drifting across the track with the two most adorable
eighth-graders waving from where they sat below the leaf. I was shifting in
my seat—I needed something to take the edge off: it would be unbearable to
see Susan faking it on the float. I wished I had brought what was left of the
dwindling supply of Valium my mother had given me before leaving for
Europe but the tangible participant had denied this. The ninth-grade float of
an American flag with pastel stars and flowers wheeled by and I was gripped
by a new sense of dread—it was compounded with the idea that I was again
being watched from somewhere in the hillsides surrounding Gilley Field, and
I realized I hadn’t seen Robert Mallory anywhere and turned around and
scanned the hundreds of people filling the stands above me. When I turned
back to the field a float of the Buckley Griffin wearing a football helmet
slowly passed, with two sophomores flanking it waving, and I was dreading
the following moments. My hands clutched at my jeans.
Debbie noticed and turned to me. “Are you okay?”
And I involuntarily asked, “What’s going on with Susan and Thom?
What’s wrong with Susan? What’s going on? Can you please fucking tell
me?”
The Junior Mints box wheeled itself across the track—cheers and
laughter as Dean McCain (admittedly hot) and Alison Garner (less so) waved
from where they sat.
“You’re asking that now?” Debbie said grimly while clapping.
“Forget it, forget it,” I muttered as the senior float appeared.
It was modified, fixed—we had spent Friday night making it cohere and
it paid off. There was the Statue of Liberty’s head with a much clearer photo
of Thom Wright’s face, and behind the head sat a replica of an L.A. street
complete with palm trees—not exactly Stansbury Avenue but no one noticed
or cared—and there was the banner that could be clearly read from the stands,
ESCAPE FROM BUCKLEY HIGH, as well as the tagline. I wasn’t surprised that the
float got a big laugh, and cheers followed as Thom Wright, in his football
jersey, and Susan Reynolds, in a skirt and a Buckley blouse, stood on the
slowly moving float being driven by Jon Yates and waved to the crowd.
Thom’s smile was genuine and excited as he took it all in, and Susan’s smile
seemed to be as well, even if it was less emphatic. I noted that Debbie
watched the float coldly. And then it was over and my dread evaporated.
Nothing bad had happened.
The Kings and Queens hopped off their respective floats, which were
driven off the field to be parked at the bottom of the hill so people could
admire them as they sat near the lane leading into the school’s parking lot.
The cheerleaders aligned into formations while the marching band played
what sounded like a medley of Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust”
followed by “Believe It or Not,” the theme from the TV show The Greatest
American Hero, and capped off with Neil Diamond’s “America.” And then
the game resumed and the Griffins won and Brentwood took the whole thing
good-naturedly—the game meant nothing, it was just fun, seventeen to seven
—and while Thom was propped up on the shoulders of his ten teammates,
and tossing his sweat-soaked hair back, basking in the manufactured delirium
of the moment, I just scanned the hills, waiting for the sniper to locate me
within the scope mounted on top of the rifle, but I wasn’t afraid anymore,
because the bullet would actually save me from the rest of the day.
And yet, I thought hopefully, there was Terry Schaffer and the
screenplay to live for, and I became an optimist again.
—
SUSAN went to the lockers to wait for Thom while Debbie and I walked
down the hill to the carnival on the field that ran across the hillside of the
elementary school—it was basically for the kids who didn’t want to watch
football. There was a miniature Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, a haunted
house, and booths with games, and tents selling food. Debbie and I shared a
Häagen-Dazs ice-cream cone and we were in that commercial again, that
couple in the travelogue, interrupted by various parents who said hello to
Debbie and the tangible participant while my main distraction was looking
for Robert Mallory, wondering if he was ever going to show up—since I
hadn’t seen him in the stands I imagined he’d be at the carnival we were
strolling through. Susan and Thom finally found us and Thom was jazzed and
freshly showered and in the suit he was going to wear at dinner and Susan
had changed into a black cocktail dress and she reminded us that drinks were
starting in the Pavilion’s lobby at six and I was suddenly relieved at how fast
the day was passing so I could stop waiting and get to the next day and
present myself and the movie I wanted to write for Terry Schaffer, whose
daughter’s hand I was holding as we walked through the crowded carnival. I
spotted Ryan with his mom and dad and younger brother, confirming that the
trio in the elevator were indeed the Vaughns—and felt nothing.
I went with Debbie to the locker rooms and Susan came with us but
everything the girls talked about in my presence was pleasant and vague—
they would talk privately when Debbie was changing. Susan brought out my
garment bag and her eyes caught mine and we held a gaze for a moment but
said nothing, and then I changed in the boys’ locker room, which was now
empty, yet there was still the lingering scent of teen bodies and soap, sweet
and stale, that always connected me to vague erotic longings. Once I was
dressed and knotting my tie in front of a mirror I found myself fighting that
particular brand of hopelessness that was again invading the cloud of
positivity the tangible participant was trying to float within. Why are you so
upset? the tangible participant asked. What is so upsetting? it asked. None of
this is real.
—
MANY OF THE PEOPLE who streamed out of Gilley Field that afternoon
and walked through the carnival were not staying for the dinner in the
Pavilion and most of our class had opted out—the dinner was open for
juniors and seniors and their parents as well as alumni, of which there were
many, but only a smattering of people from our class sat at the two large
banquet tables that lined the Pavilion’s auditorium where the basketball and
volleyball games were played, and each table sat about one hundred attendees
below the stage, where a small orchestra performed standards, and though
every seat had been sold, they were mostly filled with older alumni, none of
whom I recognized. There was a full bar set up in the lobby and waiters from
the catering staff fetched drinks for parents and the aging alumni, and there
were bottles of wine dotting the banquet tables, which were candlelit and
decorated with autumn flowers and displays of corn husks. Debbie and I sat
in the same general area as Susan and Thom, next to Laurie Wright and her
good-looking new friend, and Ryan was sitting with his family across from
Coach Holtz and his wife at the other banquet table, but it was apparent that
most of our classmates were skipping the dinner and would meet at Anthony
Matthews’s in Studio City, up Coldwater into Fryman Canyon. I barely said a
word that night: just kept scanning the Pavilion for a glimpse of Robert
Mallory, who never appeared.
—
AT ANTHONY MATTHEWS’S, DEBBIE and Susan and I situated
ourselves on chaises by the lit pool, where we lay for the duration of the
party. Tony’s parents were staying at the Sportsman’s Lodge that night, just
down the canyon on Ventura Boulevard, so we were unsupervised, but it
turned out very chill: kids from other private schools showed up and the party
turned out larger than expected but nothing got rowdy; in fact it was mellow,
with the soothing smell of gardenias drifting through the night air and kids
only drinking Coronas. Drugs were done discreetly and Debbie abstained,
because she had to be at the Windover Stables from three until six tomorrow,
and I realized that Terry had timed my arrival at the Beverly Hills Hotel to
coincide with her being unavailable. Only Tony and a couple of the guys
spending the night at the house in Fryman got trashed, and I remember very
few specifics of what happened at the party because I was just waiting and
waiting and I didn’t want to drink; I didn’t want anything. I was just
preoccupied with waiting.
And then an absence announced itself when I heard “Dreaming” by
Blondie: shadows were standing next to the pool and one of them was
wearing the same puka-shell necklace Matt Kellner wore and I realized again
that Matt had been alive and now he was dead, as if in a dream that had
dematerialized, and I was homing in on the pool, the bright square of light in
the backyard, and I kept staring deeper into it until I located the drain and I
imagined the swirl above the drain filtering the pool, and a vortex appeared in
my mind, and it was the spiral nautical shell on the cover of my calculus
textbook, and the vortex became a tornado but there wasn’t a vortex, there
wasn’t even a swirl—this was something the writer was imagining as he
waited on the chaise longue next to the two girls who were keeping a secret
from him, and it was only the occasional helicopter flying above us in the
night sky that distracted me from the vortex that wasn’t there.
—
DEBBIE DROVE ME HOME after it became apparent the party wasn’t
ending anytime soon. She thought I was tired, because I started feigning an
exaggerated yawn every two minutes, and in the driveway of the empty house
on Mulholland she started making out with me, insisting we go inside, but my
resolve was too strong and so I gently backed off and told her I’d speak to her
tomorrow, when she got back from the stables—I would have already
returned from the meeting with her father by then. I got out of the car and
grabbed my garment bag from the back seat and walked up the steps to the
house and then disappeared without waving goodbye. I waited in the foyer
until I heard her car pull out of the driveway while Shingy danced around my
legs, pawing at my feet as he followed me to the kitchen, where I let him out
onto the lawn and waited, making sure there were no coyotes scrounging the
hillsides. I just waited by the open door until he was finished, and when I
called his name he froze, mid-lawn, listening to something I couldn’t hear,
and then scampered back into the kitchen. I slid the glass door closed and
walked slowly to my bedroom.
But I couldn’t sleep and it was barely midnight and so I drove the
Mercedes through the canyons, listening to “Nowhere Girl,” until I hit
Benedict and neared the house that Robert Mallory had visited for
approximately ten minutes last week and where I prowled the backyard until
I remembered what Ronald Kellner told me on Haskell Avenue about the
mileage on the Datsun. Oh, maybe over the hill and back, but no one drove
that car to Crystal Cove. The gates were closed and I could barely make out
the WARNING: NO TRESPASSING sign that crookedly hung from them but there
was a faint light coming from one of the rooms on the second floor and it
seemed to be wavering, as if several candles were lit, but in the overall
darkness I couldn’t see if Robert’s car was in front, because none of the lights
circling the driveway were on. And then, as if someone realized a car was
idling on the canyon road below the house, the wavering lights went out, the
second-floor window darkened and I drove quickly away.
15
A VALIUM WAS ESSENTIAL TO move me through the meeting with
Terry Schaffer. I realized this when I got into the convertible Mercedes at
three-thirty to head down the canyon to the Beverly Hills Hotel and I had one
in my pocket.
I never expected to get so keyed up as the day progressed but the waiting
became unbearable and nothing could soothe it: not working out, not
swimming, not another soak in the Jacuzzi, not another jerk-off session. I
kept changing my mind about what to wear: I had a dark-green-and-brown
tweed jacket I decided on that basically went with any color dress shirt I
owned. I finally opted on just a white Ralph Lauren and then refolded all the
shirts I had tried on. I called the hotel and told them that I had a meeting in
the Polo Lounge at four o’clock and asked if jeans were allowable and was
told yes. I paced the length of the bedroom. I paced the hallway, muttering to
myself, and then into the kitchen, where I opened and closed the door of the
refrigerator a number of times. I wanted to appear as if this meeting was just
another confident yet casual moment in my hip adolescent life. I wanted
Terry Schaffer to be impressed by me. I didn’t want him to desire me exactly
—though I knew that could be the path the narrative took—but instead I
wanted him to take me seriously enough so we could make a deal for the
script. The waiting and my fantasy about the real reasons Terry wanted to
meet me at the Beverly Hills Hotel were an example, I realize now, of how
naïve I could be at seventeen despite my surface cool and the air of jaded
knowingness I was aiming for and worked so hard to project.
—
I KNEW it would only take me fifteen minutes to get to the hotel from the
house on Mulholland but I didn’t care if I was early—and I no longer cared if
this made me seem slightly desperate, because I had to get out of the empty
house and I didn’t want to risk driving around when I was this jittery and
distracted. I hoped the desperation would be reread as eagerness, as respect,
as a way of pleasing Terry. I timed the Valium and placed it in my mouth as I
turned down Benedict Canyon, letting the small yellow tablet melt under my
tongue, and I already imagined its calming effects before the pill actually hit.
I didn’t even glance at the house that was connected to Robert Mallory as I
sped past that flat section of roadway a minute later and through the light on
Hutton, just six houses below it. Everything was quiet on that Sunday in L.A.
and I rarely passed any cars until Benedict brought me to Sunset Boulevard,
where I turned left at the light, drove the length of the block the massive pink
building was situated on, and then made another left and drove past the pinegreen sign announcing the Beverly Hills Hotel at the entrance, where an
American flag was waving high above the front of the driveway lined with
towering palm trees that led upward to the valet that dropped you in front of
the entrance to the lobby.
I had been to the Beverly Hills Hotel about fifteen times when I was
thirteen, the year it seemed every bar mitzvah was held either in the Crystal
Ballroom or the Sunset Ballroom or the Rodeo Ballroom and inevitably had a
Star Wars theme, but I’d only been on the grounds beyond the ballrooms
twice before, both times when my grandparents visited L.A. from Nevada,
but they ultimately preferred the Bel Air Hotel, and so I’d never spent any
time at what was referred to as “the Pink Palace” as I got older. I had seen the
hotel in a few movies, most prominently California Suite and American
Gigolo, but the Polo Lounge had been stylized into a reconfiguration in the
Richard Gere movie and though it was certainly beautiful and worked for the
film’s aesthetic it didn’t resemble the current reality—it was dreamt up by the
visual consultant, Ferdinando Scarfiotti. I knew things like this at seventeen. I
pulled the car up to a young blond valet, dressed in a uniform of dark-green
slacks and a sea-foam-green short-sleeved Polo shirt with a black bowtie,
who opened the driver’s-side door and handed me a ticket as I stepped out
and told him I was meeting someone for a drink. I noted there were only
three cars idling in the four lanes of the valet stand on that late afternoon—a
convertible Bentley, a Cadillac and a waiting limo with tinted windows—and
even though the valet had handed me a ticket I was worried that I wouldn’t be
allowed in, that I wouldn’t pass. But I apparently did: the 450SL, the tweed
jacket, the clean-cut looks—it all seemed to work, because the valet nodded
and didn’t make me feel like the impostor I could warp myself into becoming
if I’d given myself the right dosage of self-loathing.
—
I WALKED BENEATH the pink-and-green-striped canopy that led to the
entrance doors, which a doorman pulled open, and then I entered a deserted
lobby, completely devoid of people. A fire danced in the hearth behind a
metal grate but there were only three men in suits manning the front desk off
to my right and seemingly no guests. I looked around, mildly confused,
having no idea where the Polo Lounge was located. I checked my watch—I
was about ten minutes early. I walked tentatively to the concierge desk and
asked where the Polo Lounge was—I told the concierge I had a meeting there
at four o’clock, trying to sound as official as possible. The concierge told me
that it was right around the corner and, gesturing with his hand and slightly
bowing, referred to me as “sir.” I thanked him and made my way across the
sea of green carpeting and turned left, where I saw the entrance of the Polo
Lounge but not before I glanced down an impossibly long corridor lined with
banana-leaf wallpaper—completely deserted, reminding me of something out
of The Shining if it had been set in Southern California. But it was a Sunday
and checkout was probably at twelve and this must have been the reason why
it was so quiet and there were no people anywhere—the weekend was over.
When I told the host who I was here to meet he asked me to take a seat at the
bar and he would call Mr. Schaffer and let him know I’d arrived. I
automatically wondered what that meant: call Mr. Schaffer? But I didn’t say
anything.
The small bar directly next to the entrance sat six and all the stools were
empty and the room was dotted with only a few couples talking softly to each
other in the hazy light of late afternoon. The bartender asked me what I’d like
and I ordered a ginger ale, explaining that I was waiting for someone,
suggesting that I was important. After the bartender served the ginger ale he
placed a small bowl of light-green dip surrounded by tortilla chips next to the
glass, and that I didn’t touch. Why would the host have to call Terry? I
wondered. Was he staying in the hotel? Was he driving in from somewhere
else? The Valium had kicked in and these questions floated away as I drifted
into a vague, soothing calmness and sipped the ginger ale. While I kept
waiting, however, I started thinking about the house on Benedict Canyon that
Robert Mallory had disappeared into and the candlelit window I passed by
last night and the things Robert did to Matt in that house the week Matt was
missing. The thought was interrupted by a familiar voice. “Hey, Bret.” I
tightened up. It was Steven Reinhardt.
I turned on the stool and pretended not to be surprised. “Hey, Steven.”
—
I HADN’T SEEN HIM since the lunch at Trumps and nothing had changed:
the same turtleneck and the extra-small jeans that still hung baggy on his
bone-thin frame, the deep-set eyes locked into an emaciated skull topped with
a frizzy mop of blond curly hair. He was grinning at me but there was no
friendliness within the smile. I always sensed a desperation emanating from
him and yet he was Terry Schaffer’s assistant, his right-hand man, and I
always tried to defer to him until I couldn’t. There was something unbearable
about Steven Reinhardt and he filled me with a light disgust that I simply
couldn’t hide anymore.
“Where’s Terry?” I asked. “Is he going to be late?”
Steven kept grinning at me, and then he shook his head slightly, as if in
mild disbelief. “So—you made it,” he said. “You actually came.” He paused.
“I almost made a bet with Terry that you wouldn’t.”
“Why wouldn’t I come?” I immediately asked, confused. “Why would
you make a bet?” I asked.
Steven raised his eyebrows, the grin disappeared, and he glanced around
the empty room. “I don’t know. I guess I’m always surprised by a person’s
level of, um, propriety or lack of it, I guess. Or self-interest. Or selfdelusion.” He said this calmly and with no rancor but it sounded like the
insult he intended. “How badly they want something. La la la.” He paused
again. “I’m always surprised what they think they’re capable of. What they
think they’re going to get away with.” He paused once more. “I guess I
shouldn’t be, but I am.”
My face had become a scowl. “What does that mean?” I grimaced.
“What are you talking about? Terry wanted a meeting with me and I came.
What are you fucking blathering on about, Steven? You set this up.”
Steven registered my displeasure and innocently opened his arms and
said, “It means absolutely nothing, Bret, calm down.” He reconsidered. “Or it
means whatever you want it to mean.” He paused. “I wasn’t necessarily
talking about you.” He cocked his head slightly. “You’re more innocent than
that, right?”
“It means whatever I want it to mean?” I asked. “It doesn’t mean
anything, Steven. It means that Terry set up a meeting about a script and I’m
here.”
“Whatever, whatever…” Steven said gently. “No need to get pissed.”
“I’m not pissed. You just seem surprised that I’m here,” I said. “Why
should you be? Terry set this meeting up. Why would you be surprised that I
would show up to a meeting?”
“Well, I thought you might’ve been hungover from Homecoming,”
Steven said. “You went to Homecoming, right?”
I stared at him. I didn’t say anything. He stared back.
“What does Homecoming have to do with anything?” I asked.
“Was it fun?” he asked. “Did you and Debbie have fun?”
I didn’t say anything. I wanted to look anywhere else but at the death
mask that was Steven Reinhardt’s face. I kept calm, though a twisting anger
was trying to break through the Valium haze. “Yeah,” I finally said with no
emotion. “It was fun.”
He gestured to the bar. “Did you have…a drink?”
“Um, I just, um, had a ginger ale,” I stammered. “I’m fine.”
“You should’ve probably had a drink,” he murmured.
“I didn’t want a drink, Steven,” I said, calmly.
“Hey, Gene.” Steven motioned to the bartender. “Put it on Terry’s tab.”
The bartender shook his head while wiping a glass. “On the house.”
This was my cue to stand and I did so hesitantly. I suddenly realized
something. “Where are we going?” I asked.
Steven just said, “I’m taking you to Terry.”
“Aren’t we having the meeting in the Polo Lounge? I thought we were
having the meeting in the Polo Lounge.”
Something slightly snapped in Steven and in retrospect I realize that it
was my naïveté that annoyed him. “No, you’re not having your meet-ing with
Terry in the Polo Lounge, Bret.” He started walking out into the lobby. I
followed him.
“Where are we having the meeting?” I asked as Steven pushed open a
glass door that led to a pink pathway just outside the entrance of the Polo
Lounge next to a pair of elevator banks locked in the wallpaper swathed with
banana palms, and just around the corner was that endless and deserted
corridor.
“Your ‘meeting,’ your ‘meeting,’ ” he said. “What do you think your
meeting is about, Bret?” He turned his head, smiling, as he glanced at me.
“I think it’s about a script Terry wants me to write,” I said. “I’ve got an
idea.”
The pathway kept winding and flora was draped everywhere and vines of
bougainvillea exploded across the banana leaves. Steven didn’t say anything,
just kept walking forward along the pink path.
“Where are we going?” I asked again, this time trying to sound casual—
the Valium helped but I was realizing not only that there had been a change
of venue but also perhaps what the meaning of the meeting itself was and
there seemed to be a new sense of purpose about what I was doing at the
Beverly Hills Hotel at four o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. Or maybe I was
hearing things that weren’t really there.
“Terry wants to take the meeting in the bungalow,” Steven said.
“What bungalow?” I asked.
We had suddenly stopped in front of what looked like the façade of a
faded pink cottage. A simple set of steps led to a white door with green trim.
“Is this normal?” I asked. “Does Terry usually do this?”
Steven was facing me when he asked: “Is there something wrong?” He
stopped. “You seem confused.”
“No,” I said. “But I didn’t think we were going to have a meeting in a
hotel room—”
“It’s a bungalow,” Steven said. “It’s not a hotel room—”
“If I had been told this I would have worn something more casual—”
“You look fine,” Steven said. “A little overeager but fine.”
“Why doesn’t he just take the meetings at Stone Canyon, then?” I asked.
“He always books a bungalow on weekends instead,” Steven said. “And
because Debbie and Liz are in the house on Stone Canyon—”
“But Debbie is at the stables today—”
“Bret—” Steven warned quietly.
“What about the offices?” I asked. “On Wilshire?”
“It’s the weekend.” Steven shrugged. “It’s a Sunday,” he said pointedly,
as if this meant something I couldn’t grasp.
“Quite a little chatterbox today, aren’t you?” Steven said. “Got your big
movie idea all ready for Terry? You going to pitch your new script?”
“I have an idea,” I said defensively. “I just don’t understand why we’re
not in the Polo Lounge.”
Two older men wearing tennis shorts with sweaters tied across their
shoulders were walking along the pink path and checked me out as they
passed us. I should have been flattered but in that moment I was just grossed
out. Steven waited until they were out of earshot and then said: “Look, you’re
at the Beverly Hills Hotel on a Sunday afternoon meeting Terry Schaffer.
You got yourself all dressed up. You’re so eager. You’re so willing. I warned
you not to take any of this seriously. And yet you’re still here.” Steven
shrugged. “I really thought that you wouldn’t show up. That you understood
something.”
I just stared at him. “Like…what?” I asked, completely confused. “Look,
Steven, I don’t want any problems between us. I’m just trying to figure
something out.”
“What are you trying to figure out, Bret?” Steven asked and perhaps for
the first moment of that afternoon was genuinely curious as to what I was
going to say.
But I realized that I was very relaxed due to the Valium and that not only
did I have no idea what I was trying to figure out but I also didn’t care. In that
moment I understood I was going to have to let it play out—whatever it was.
This was suddenly so funny to me that I couldn’t help but laugh. Steven
stared while I put my hands on my hips and looked around, laughing softly to
myself. I was laughing at me, at Steven, at the implausibility of the new
location, the situation itself. I had opened a door and I was going to walk
through it and I knew what the possibilities were and I went in anyway.
“You think this is funny?” Steven asked. “Good. That’s good.”
Steven waited for me to say something and I didn’t and then he turned
and led me to the door of the cottage, which I realized was the bungalow that
Terry was waiting in. “Terry’s on the patio, probably still on the phone,”
Steven said. “Make yourself comfortable.” And then he added, before turning
away, “Go with the flow.”
—
I MOVED SLOWLY into the bungalow and shut the door behind me. The
room I walked into was spread out with thick white carpeting and the walls
were painted a pale green. There was a room-service cart with an opened
bottle of champagne in an ice bucket, Dom Pérignon, along with three crystal
flutes. Pink curtains patterned with the trademark banana-palm fronds were
draped over the windows, darkening the living room, which was softly lit
with recessed lighting, and where two sofas sat across from each other, lined
with pastel pillows, divided by a glass coffee table on which a vase of pink
roses sat, and then past the living room was a dining area I moved through,
brightly lit because the windows were open, and then I was peering into a
room, where there was a king-sized bed and a TV on a stand—a football
game was playing with the sound off—and the bedsheets were the same pale
green as the satin headboard, and the shutters were closed and latched but the
slats were open, allowing a faint breeze in. I remember that I noticed there
were ashtrays everywhere though Terry didn’t smoke: on all the tables, on the
nightstands in the bedroom, on the bar, on the desk, on the small dining table.
I moved down another hallway, where I could hear Terry’s voice more
clearly, and followed the sound, passing through a kitchen where a door
opened onto a patio. Terry was on the phone, the cord trailing behind him,
wearing sandals and a very short robe that almost resembled a white toga,
and his Porsche Carrera sunglasses were on even though the patio was shaded
by the tropical flora that draped over it blocking out the sun and he was
smoking a joint, a half-empty flute of the Dom in his other hand. He noticed
me, smiled as if surprised, held the receiver away from his mouth, and said
quietly, “Help yourself to a drink.”
I nodded and then moved back through the kitchen and into the living
room and switched on a chrome lamp with a white shade by the bar and sat
on one of four stools lining the marble countertop, where a bowl of
chrysanthemums glowed dimly. I looked over the shelf of bottles and realized
I didn’t want a drink—I didn’t need any alcohol, the Valium was enough.
Why was Terry wearing that robe? I thought to myself. It really sucked that
he thought something was going to happen with me, and yet Steven
Reinhardt was correct in his assumptions: I was here, I drove myself here, I
walked with Steven to the bungalow, I closed the door behind me. Go with
the flow. I eventually poured myself half a glass of the champagne and took a
single sip while my eyes scanned the room: a painting of a peacock, a
drawing of lilies. And then I realized that Terry had followed me in when I
looked up at the mirror behind the bar, and he was watching me intently, still
on the phone, listening to whoever was on the other end of the line. I became
self-conscious and though I wasn’t actually going to drink the champagne I
downed the glass and poured myself another, tipping the glass as my parents
had taught me so the flute wouldn’t foam over. I drank half that as well and
started getting buzzed. I’d known automatically that something was off about
the setup—the bungalow instead of the Polo Lounge, Terry’s robe, the open
bottle of champagne—but I didn’t leave because I was moving into the world
of adults and I wanted to find out what would happen to me.
—
TERRY MOVED BACK into the kitchen to hang up the phone and then he
was gliding toward the middle of the living room. He took me in and smiled,
stoned. “You made it, I’m glad. You look great.” Terry held his empty flute
with a steady hand as he poured himself another glass of champagne and then
sat down on the couch facing the bar, where I was now standing and gently
lowered myself back onto one of the stools, across the room from him. And
then I realized where this afternoon was supposed to land in Terry’s mind
when I saw that he wasn’t wearing a bathing suit or a pair of underwear
beneath the robe. Terry had taken off the sunglasses and smiled boyishly at
me—he wasn’t faggy or fey but the robe and the somewhat visible genitalia
were not bringing me over to his side of the aisle; they had the opposite of the
intended effect and I became briefly angry at myself for being there, but I
was mildly high on Valium and, along with the champagne, I felt a kind of
peace in letting go.
“How are you doing, Bret?” Terry asked. “Everything okay?”
“I’m…okay,” I said. And then realized that I was going to play the
sympathy card to disarm him and it came so easily because it was genuine: if
I wanted to in that moment I could have easily burst into tears about Matt
Kellner. I was suddenly emotional and I said his name. I told Terry that I’d
been thinking about him while waiting in the Polo Lounge. And that it was
hard.
“Who?” Terry asked. He was busy relighting the joint. “Matt?”
“Um, Matt Kellner. He was in our class,” I said. “At Buckley. He
recently died.”
“Oh, right, right,” Terry said, realizing. “Debbie mentioned that to me.
He overdosed? What happened?”
“Actually, I think he drowned. I don’t know—”
“Drowned?” Terry asked, taken aback. “How did he drown?”
“Accidentally,” I said. “Or so they think.” I paused. “Maybe it was an
overdose,” I muttered. “No one knows.”
“Well, let’s not be a downer, because that’s not what we’re here for,”
Terry said. “It happened. I’m sorry. But you need to focus on the future.”
“Well, that’s why I’m here,” I said, sipping from the flute.
“You want a real drink?” Terry asked.
“I really don’t even want this one,” I said, placing the flute on the bar.
“You want a hit?” he asked, offering me the joint.
“No, I’m okay.” I was scanning the living room of the bungalow. “This
is nice.”
“Yeah,” Terry said. “My home away from home.”
“Why didn’t we take the meeting in the Polo Lounge?” I asked.
Terry stared at me with a slight grin as if this was a question he hadn’t
expected, and didn’t say anything until, “I like it here, more comfortable,
more privacy.”
“Terry, let’s just talk about the script,” I said. “Because nothing’s going
to happen. I know you think it might happen but it’s not.” I looked around the
room and then landed on him. “I’m here to talk about a script.”
“Really?” Terry asked, seriously. “What’s not going to happen?” He
mimicked someone confused.
I sighed theatrically. “I thought you wanted to talk about a script. I
thought that was what the meeting was about.”
“I do, I do,” he said. “Let’s talk about it.”
“I mean if I made a mistake and you want me to go…” I trailed off,
leaving the sentence unfinished.
I stared at him and he stared back and then he started laughing. “I’m
sorry, I’m sorry,” he was saying. “It’s just that I don’t know what you were
expecting.” He paused. “I don’t really know what you’re talking about.” I just
stared at him with an utter blankness. “I mean, I guess this was a bit of a dare
on my part. But I didn’t really think you’d think…”
A blush had swept across me, and it felt as if my entire body had
reddened.
“You didn’t really think what?” I asked.
“I guess I was just fooling around and I didn’t think you would take it so
seriously,” he said.
“You thought this was all a joke?” I asked.
“No, Bret, no, not at all,” Terry said, registering my hurt. “Of course, I’m
interested in a script—”
“But, then, what’s the problem?”
“There’s no problem…” Terry stopped. “Okay, tell me what the script is
about.”
“You don’t really want to hear it, do you?” I said, sighing.
“You’re in a kind of self-defeating mood,” he said, and downed the
champagne. “Look, we’re here, I’m here, we’re having a meeting, I want to
hear about the idea you have for the script.” He paused. “But come over here.
I can barely see you.” He gestured at the couch across from the one he was
sitting on. I hesitantly pushed away from the stool and started walking across
the room, but before sitting down poured myself another glass of champagne.
Terry had crossed his legs and pulled the hem of the robe tight over his thighs
so that nothing was visible. “I’m listening,” he said gently. “Tell me a story.”
—
I WAS CALM ENOUGH to start telling Terry about the movie I’d been
envisioning in my mind for the past few weeks but realized about five
minutes in that I actually hadn’t fully thought it out to the degree where I
could coherently tell it to someone. The Valium and champagne emboldened
me to start thinking out loud as I moved the characters from the beginning of
the movie until its violent ending but I kept going back and re-explaining
incidents from different angles, and what made this worse was how
authoritative I tried to sound, almost as if I was the director and suggesting
particular ways scenes should be shot and how I pictured certain camera
movements. Terry listened to the whole thing, occasionally nodding, or
pointing something out that contradicted what I’d said previously. There was
the moment when I tried to explain a dolly shot and realized Terry had zoned
out and was patiently waiting for me to wrap it up, but I hadn’t thought about
how to wrap it up and I started punctuating the pitch with “But maybe this
could happen instead” and when I glanced at my watch I was embarrassed to
see that I’d sucked up thirty minutes of our time with this gibberish. I might
have been thinking about this idea for weeks—and at some points I thought
what I’d constructed would make an amazing movie—but now, sitting on the
sofa across from Terry in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel, I realized
that the whole thing was preposterous, a truly lame idea, and I quickly ended
the pitch—I actually said, “The End.” Terry was frozen with boredom and
slow to react—it seemed as if he was politely trying to think of something
nice to say. I had finished the champagne and needed to use the restroom—an
escape. Terry just sat there, smiled tightly and said there was one around the
corner in the bedroom.
I stood up, my legs wobbled, and then I walked through a hallway and
into the bedroom, where I stood still in front of the breeze coming through an
opened slat from the shutters. In the bathroom it seemed like I pissed
endlessly, and then flushed the toilet and washed my hands while looking at
myself in the mirror. You did this to yourself, I thought. You ended up here.
No one forced you. No one held a gun up to your head. You wanted to come.
—
WHEN I LEFT the bathroom Terry was standing in the doorway of the
bedroom. I stopped. Again I felt the breeze touch my face as it floated
through the slats of the opened shutters.
“Okay,” he said flatly. “I like it. You want to make a deal?”
I was stunned, then flooded with relief. “You liked it?”
“Yeah,” Terry said. “There’s something there.”
“Really?” I slowly nodded.
“So—do you want to make a deal or not?”
“Yeah, sure,” I said, hoping I didn’t sound too eager.
“That was thirty minutes of my time,” he said. “And now I want thirty
minutes of yours.”
There was a silence. “What does that mean?” I mumbled. I knew exactly
what he meant but I just wanted to postpone the reality of the situation.
“Quid pro quo.” He shrugged.
“What does that mean?” I asked again, staring at him from across the
room.
“Why don’t you get comfortable,” he said—it wasn’t a suggestion.
“I…am comfortable,” I said.
“Why don’t you lose the jacket,” Terry said flatly.
I automatically took the jacket off and tossed it onto an armchair I was
standing next to. I realized I’d been sweating during the pitch and my
underarms and back were damp with perspiration.
“And you can take off the shirt, too,” he said.
He took a step into the room, watching me.
I unbuttoned the shirt and tossed it onto the jacket.
Terry dispassionately looked me over as if inspecting a delicate object
that he wasn’t quite sure he was interested in and then took another step into
the room, closer to the bed. He kicked off his sandals. I waited. I just stood
there, my arms hanging limply by my sides, not knowing what to do next. I
could have made this more playful—flexed, laughed, jumped on the bed,
eager to consummate the deal—instead of coming off as, Terry intimated
earlier, a downer, but I just wanted to get it over with and I didn’t want to
hear his voice instructing me what to do. I kicked the Topsiders off and then
unzipped the jeans and tossed them onto the armchair with the shirt and the
jacket, until I was just standing in my jockey shorts in front of Terry. He
walked over and untied the belt of his robe and I averted my eyes so that I
was only looking at his face—I didn’t want to see his body, his chest, his
dick. Without saying anything, he pulled me up against him and roughly
kissed my mouth and I let him at first but, tasting an acrid combination of
weed and champagne, I pushed him firmly away. He grinned, and placed his
hands on my chest, lighting squeezing my pecs, and then playfully shoved
me. I lost my balance and fell onto the bed, where Terry pulled down my
underwear and I accommodated him, lifting my feet off the floor so he could
remove them completely, and then he immediately got on his knees as I
stared at the ceiling—I hadn’t felt any real excitement even though I got fully
hard as Terry kept sucking and stroking my cock. I lifted my head and
glimpsed his body—he was thin and tan and basically in good shape and,
writing this now, I realize he looked younger than he actually was. On a
surface level he was attractive for his age but he was just too old for me to
even contemplate as a realistic sex partner when I was seventeen, and yet
there I was: lying on the green sheets as he devoured my cock, slapping it
against his face, deep-throating and inhaling it. After what seemed like a
couple of minutes he grabbed my hips and rolled me onto my stomach and
then lifted my ass up and I felt the stubble around his mouth and then his
tongue. This went on for what seemed like minutes as well until he suddenly
pushed a finger deep inside me and I reached around and grabbed his wrist,
which slipped from my grasp as he stood and began rubbing his cock against
my asshole, trying to push it in, pressing it against the anus he had just wetted
with his saliva, and then Terry slipped two fingers deeply into me and it hurt
and I grabbed his wrist again and forced him to pull his hand away. I rolled
onto my back. He pushed my legs up until my knees were suddenly touching
my chest and I said “No” and kicked away.
It was completely silent except for the breeze teasing the trees outside the
bungalow as I looked over at the football game playing on the TV until Terry
repositioned himself on the bed and started sucking my cock while he
rammed himself down my throat—we were in a 69 position. He was pumping
too hard or maybe he was too excited and couldn’t help himself or maybe this
was how older guys did it—roughly, dispassionately—I’d only been with
Matt and Ryan. I grabbed his hips to steady him so that I could breathe but
then he was ejaculating and I felt, then tasted, the semen shooting down my
throat and coating my mouth, his balls pressed against my nostrils. He
groaned deeply with my cock in his mouth as he came and then continued
sucking me off as I pulled my head away and his already softening penis
slipped out, and then I surprised myself as I started climaxing—my orgasm
had come from nowhere, it hadn’t built, I barely knew it was arriving, my
legs were spread and Terry had two fingers pushed deep inside me. And then
it was over. Terry swallowed all of it.
He rolled off me onto his back and waited until his panting subsided.
Terry wiped a hand across his mouth and started laughing good-naturedly and
looked at me as he said, glassy-eyed, “That was intense.” I tried to sound
enthusiastic when I responded, “Yeah,” as I pushed myself off the bed and
walked to the bathroom, where I closed the door, then sat on the toilet and
wiped Terry’s saliva off my asshole. When I looked at the piece of tissue I
noticed there was a small streak of blood from where his fingernail had
scratched my rectum. I dampened a Kleenex and wiped again until there was
no more blood. I washed my mouth out with warm water and then stared at
my face in the mirror. I looked not only remarkably composed but as if I’d
actually accomplished something—it wasn’t what I wanted but it wasn’t so
bad. I was okay. I took a deep breath and walked back into the bedroom
naked, relieved that Terry wasn’t there. I could hear his voice from outside—
he had returned to the patio and was on the phone. I picked up my jockey
shorts off the floor and pulled them on and after getting dressed walked
through the hallway to the kitchen and leaned out to where Terry was sitting
at a table: the robe was on, there was a fresh glass of champagne, another
joint had been lit, Herb Alpert’s “Rise” was playing from somewhere. I
offered a wave and a smile, gesturing that I had to go. He nodded and said,
“We’ll talk soon, Bret, thank you,” and then I was walking through the
darkened living room and out the front door to the pink pathway that would
take me back to the lobby of the hotel. I passed the Polo Lounge, then moved
under the canopy to the valet, tipped him, and then drove aimlessly until I
returned to the empty house on Mulholland. It was barely five o’clock by the
time I left the hotel. Everything had happened within the space of an hour.
Neither Terry Schaffer nor I would know what was happening outside
the window of the bedroom while the two of us had sex that afternoon in
early October: we didn’t know that somewhere deep in the flora on the
grounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel I’d been photographed walking into
Terry’s bungalow and neither of us could hear the rapid clicking and the whir
of a camera that was aimed at the bed Terry and I were lying on through the
open slats of the shutters that lined the bedroom’s windows. We would find
this out later, as the fall of 1981 moved inexorably toward its ironic and
tragic conclusion.

THE PARTY SUSAN REYNOLDS was throwing “secretly” for Robert
Mallory became the main distraction that following week at Buckley. The
party was coming up on Saturday after having been postponed twice: once
because of Matt Kellner’s death and the other time for Homecoming. But
when that night in mid-October finally arrived I’m not sure if Robert Mallory
was completely unaware that Susan was throwing the party for him, which
she had told Thom Wright and Debbie Schaffer and myself weeks ago, in
early September, when she mentioned throwing a party specifically for him
as a way of making this new student feel comfortable and accepted by his
classmates. The party seemed like a plot to disarm Robert Mallory, since
we’d found out that he spent six months in a mental institution outside of
Jacksonville, Illinois—and for me, and not Susan or Thom or Debbie, the
party suggested that Robert was too delicate and we needed to be so careful
and we should placate him even though we didn’t quite know what was
wrong with him yet. Why had he been in the developmental center? What
had he done that placed him there? Was it only depression and mild usage of
marijuana and hallucinogens? Was it due to the aftermath of his mother’s
death and the frustration he felt toward his father and the new wife? Or was it
something darker that Robert could never admit to us and that we would
never fully know? And yet the inner voice of the tangible participant argued:
how bad could it have really been if he’d only spent six months there and
been released last summer and was now wandering among us in sunny L.A.?
The rest of the senior class, I’m supposing, didn’t know anything about this
angle, and yet I think Robert sensed something about the party by the time it
finally happened and maybe he had already learned about it from someone in
particular, confirming that this was, indeed, the case: the party is being
thrown for you, Robert, by Susan Reynolds in order for you to feel accepted
because—and here was the dark truth—she has feelings for you.
Why would anyone, at this point, think that Susan Reynolds would be
the cheerleader for a charity event when the community had already
embraced Robert Mallory? The semester was flying by and in the six weeks
since Robert arrived at Buckley he had been accepted, even desired, by the
entirety of the twelfth grade and admired by all the other classes even though,
I noticed, he did absolutely nothing to encourage this—he just passively
accepted it. In mid-autumn he was simply very popular: besides his
handsomeness—like Thom Wright he could look rugged and masculine and
then, depending on an expression or emotion, sensitive and almost boyish—
there was a quiet mystery about him that girls were almost instantaneously
attracted to and gossiped about, and it also helped that Thom Wright actually
liked Robert and it seemed they were becoming friends in ways that I might
have expected—and dreaded—when they first met on that Tuesday in
September, but this burgeoning friendship that I really hadn’t been paying
attention to had suddenly happened, and it gave off a signal to the rest of the
student body, confirming: Hey, if Robert’s my friend he’s okay. He’s just
another God, like me. That week before the party I kept calling the number
I’d found in Matt Kellner’s drawer with the letters RM next to it and nobody
ever picked up and there wasn’t an answering machine where I could leave a
message.
—
THAT WEEK FOUND ME in another dazed moment and it had nothing to
do with what had happened at the Beverly Hills Hotel with Terry Schaffer,
which hadn’t bothered me in any substantial way, and I wasn’t shocked how
easily I could compartmentalize it: yes, I was technically “underage” but no
one had hurt me, I hadn’t been assaulted, I let it happen, I made it easier for
Terry to take my underwear off and bring me to an orgasm, and I really had
no feelings either way about what transpired in the bedroom of the bungalow
on that Sunday in October. I simply hoped it would lead to a scriptwriting gig
but there was the possibility that it wouldn’t: that the offer had been
ephemeral, a tease, a ploy to let him taste my cock and rim me, suck me off
and fuck my mouth. I wasn’t going to get pushy about the quid pro quo of it
or use what I thought was my advantage over Terry by threatening to relay it
to his daughter if he didn’t acquiesce to my demands, because I soon realized
Terry and I had a shared list of disadvantages to worry about if Debbie was
ever told or found out about the relationship between myself and her father.
And I needed Debbie my senior year and I was going to try harder to be that
caring boyfriend she so badly desired, though there were parts of that other
boyfriend—the colder, distant one—that I think she also responded to. But I
had to keep track of my aloofness because sometimes I could so easily slip
into the role of the zombie she’d identified that week in early September and
had called me out on even though there was something about my cold
disregard that I knew excited her as well. I would play the role as best I could
in order to please her and become the tangible participant whenever she was
around. But in that dazed week before Susan’s party Debbie was always at
the Windover Stables training with Spirit and I don’t remember seeing her
that much in the days after I’d met her father at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
I may have barely made it through the week without collapsing but by
Friday afternoon the rest of my classmates were excited and buzzing over the
party. Susan’s parents weren’t going to be there. Susan had invited a group of
good-looking and popular juniors. Susan told people to bring their bathing
suits if they wanted to dip into the pool or Jacuzzi. Susan was having the
party catered: chopped salads from La Scala, platters of nigiri delivered from
Teru Sushi. A few people were going to spend the night, including Thom,
even though his mom’s house was also in the flats of Beverly Hills, barely
ten blocks away, and so was Debbie, and Jeff and Tracy were invited as well
as myself, and Robert. But I was noncommittal and told Susan “Maybe.” I
heard nothing from Terry or Steven Reinhardt that week and I barely noticed
Ryan Vaughn or the absence of Matt because something else happened that
erased everything and it became my focal point in those days leading up to
Susan’s party: another girl had disappeared.
—
IT WAS ON MONDAY MORNING that I found out about the missing girl
in an article in the Los Angeles Times. My alarm had gone off at seven-thirty
and I stared at the ceiling in the empty house on Mulholland, and realized
after several minutes passed while I lay immobile on the king-sized bed that I
was allowing myself to creep closer toward that widening despair I could so
easily fall into if I didn’t combat it by becoming the tangible participant. I
heaved myself off the bed and opened the bedroom door. Shingy scrambled
onto the lawn and I swam a number of laps, letting the pool’s cold water
awaken and distract me from the gathering ennui. I took a long hot shower
and got dressed, mentally preparing myself for the day—the weeks, the
endless months—ahead. I didn’t turn on the TV or play any music as I looked
over whatever homework I’d completed the night before—despite what went
down in the bungalow I was decidedly calm and easily concentrated on the
assignments that were due the following day—and then placed my textbooks
in the Gucci backpack and walked down the hallway to the kitchen, where I
greeted Rosa with a smile I hoped wasn’t too forced. She was standing in
front of the opened refrigerator compiling a list when I asked her if she could
make me an omelet por favor. The Los Angeles Times was sitting on the
island along with a stack of magazines she’d retrieved from the mailbox at
the end of the driveway: Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Vogue, GQ: on its
cover Michael Schoeffling’s handsome face briefly distracted me.
I poured myself a glass of orange juice and unfolded the L.A. Times and
immediately saw in the bottom right-hand corner on the front page a photo of
a local teenage girl and the announcement that Audrey Barbour, age
seventeen, had been missing for three days. It took a stunned moment for the
light chill of dread to get activated when I realized this was probably the
Trawler’s next victim, and I automatically wondered where she was right
now, if she was already dead or being kept alive somewhere, bound and
tortured and bleeding out. I became lightly nauseated when I smelled the
omelet that was now being prepared on the stove adjacent to the island where
I stood and realized there was no way I’d be able to eat it. I heard something
pop out of the toaster and then a plate was placed next to the paper I was
staring at as Rosa told me about all the things she needed to get done today,
but I could barely hear her as my eyes scanned the article.
—
AUDREY BARBOUR HAD BEEN with a group of friends at the Promenade
mall in Woodland Hills on Friday night when she announced she was
leaving. She wanted to go home and watch the fifth-season premiere of
Dallas, which would reveal the identity of the dead woman floating in the
Southfork swimming pool that ended the fourth-season finale last spring, and
Audrey didn’t want it taped—she wanted to watch the episode as it aired. She
left the group and apparently walked through the lot behind the mall where
her car was parked, at around nine. A couple entering the Robinson’s that
anchored the south end of the mall told the police they had passed by the girl
as she was leaving, which corroborated a time line established by the group
of friends. Audrey didn’t make it back to her parents’ house in Calabasas by
nine-thirty, which they thought was unlike her since Audrey stressed she
would be home by then to take a shower and get ready to watch Dallas at ten,
and yet she hadn’t called from the Promenade telling them she would be
staying out later than she initially thought and asking her father to tape the
show for her. Audrey Barbour was pretty in the same generic ways Katherine
Latchford and Julie Selwyn and Sarah Johnson were but on that Monday, in
the article I read, she hadn’t been “officially” tied to the girls and linked to
the Trawler, even though later that week it would be discovered that two dogs
had gone missing in the Bell Canyon neighborhood, near where she lived,
days before her disappearance, but Audrey’s parents didn’t remember
anything about furniture being rearranged or the sense that anyone had
entered the house or that their daughter had been targeted by someone, and
the only home invasion and subsequent assault that matched the Trawler’s
style in that general area had happened in the faraway summer of 1980.
However, later that week Audrey Barbour’s friends confirmed that
Audrey had told them about the phone calls she was receiving on her private
line because Audrey had been so curiously compelled by them; her parents
knew nothing about the phone calls. It was rare but not unusual in 1981 for
certain teenagers to have their own phone lines; Matt Kellner had one,
Debbie Schaffer had one, as did Susan Reynolds and Thom Wright and
myself, as well as Robert Mallory, I suspected. Audrey had been annoyed by
the phone calls at first, the silences punctuated by heavy breathing and sighs,
but once the irritation subsided she started to actually talk to the silence on
the other end of the line, admitting things, chatting about guys she thought
were hot, sometimes mentioning a sexual fantasy to whoever she was now
flirting with on the other end—and she admitted to her friends that she
thought she could hear the person masturbating because of the wet sounds
and the animal panting, and sometimes she thought it was two people.
Audrey Barbour’s friends said that there were no actual conversations,
because the person on the phone never spoke. Often Audrey would waste an
afternoon just waiting for the unknown person to call so she could tell it
about her day and talk about cute boys and tease it with insinuations.

IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES article there was the first mention of a
poster, but no one had connected the meaning of the poster Audrey Barbour
received with the other posters and it became an odd detail hanging there—so
specific that it seemed meaningless to add into an article where so much was
unknown and unresolved: a “gift” had been left on the front porch of the
house in Bell Canyon, a poster for the record Entertainment! It was by Gang
of Four, a band that Audrey hadn’t even particularly liked and only knew a
song or two from; she thought, according to her friends, that the “secret
admirer”—this was what she now called him—had left it for her. No one had
found out that this was part of the targeting: the delivery of the posters to
homes of potential victims. When I read that detail about the poster I
immediately wondered: who left the poster in the mailbox on Haskell Avenue
for Matt Kellner? And then I asked myself: if you received a poster did that
mean you died? Or were there teenagers all over L.A. the Trawler was
targeting and leaving the posters for regardless of whether he was going to
kill them or not? When Audrey hadn’t made it home to watch Dallas that
night her parents called all of her friends but it was a Friday and none of them
were home, and when the Barbours finally drove out to the Promenade, long
after it closed, they found their daughter’s white VW Rabbit sitting alone
beneath the sodium glow of an arc light in the vast parking lot. Audrey
Barbour had never made it to her car.

I REALIZED at a certain point I hadn’t touched the omelet or the piece of
buttered wheat toast next to it and when I tried to take a bite I just gagged and
spit it into a napkin. I pushed away from the island and walked slowly to the
garage without saying goodbye to Rosa and sat in the driver’s seat of the
450SL and waited until I became motivated to switch on the ignition and pull
the car out of the driveway and pass the boxwood hedge and merge with the
traffic racing along Mulholland and focus on the road taking me down into
the Valley and the gates of Buckley. But the disappearance of Audrey
Barbour kept distracting me and it changed everything that week. As did the
fact that Robert Mallory wasn’t on Gilley Field last Friday night. He had left
around six o’clock, when it was getting dark, and I’d seen him leave. I
watched from the other end of the senior float as Robert said something to
Thom Wright, who was on a stepladder realigning the buildings that were
supposed to replicate Stansbury Avenue, and the two of them talked softly for
half a minute and then Robert left after Thom nodded. Thom turned his
attention back to the float and after a moment looked up. I hadn’t realized I
was still staring at Robert over Thom’s shoulder as he walked across the
baseball field to the hill leading down to the parking lot. But Thom thought I
was staring at him and just flashed a Thom Wright smile at me, white and
beaming with reassurance, while he adjusted a papier-mâché palm tree. Why
had I thought in that moment—and the thought arrived instantly, unbidden—
Thom Wright was doomed?
—
IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO SUSAN’S PARTY I kept reading various
articles about the disappearance of Audrey Barbour in both the Los Angeles
Times and the Herald Examiner and was automatically aware of the
connection the media were making between the Trawler and the missing girl
even though the Trawler never called anyone that week—not the LAPD or
the Los Angeles Times—to own responsibility for the disappearance, which
wasn’t necessarily unusual, because the self-described monster and “his
friends” usually called after he dumped their bodies at a specific site—though
both the LAPD and the L.A. Times admitted that week there had been phone
calls from the suspect during the weeks Julie Selwyn and Sarah Johnson were
missing, but not Katherine Latchford. The local media convinced themselves
that Audrey Barbour was the fourth victim of the serial killer and this was
more or less the confirmed narrative the week after her disappearance even if
the LAPD said they were not “leaping to that particular conclusion at all,”
because there was still hope she would be found, and they reminded everyone
that it was very early in the investigation. And yet it seemed so plausible that
the Trawler had caused this girl to vanish and was out there somewhere
torturing her to death if she wasn’t already killed. I don’t know why I was
naïve enough to assume that the disappearance of Audrey Barbour would in
some way distract or worry my classmates at Buckley. But no one talked
about it. No one seemed to care. Another girl had disappeared, but girls were
disappearing all the time, some of them ran away, some of them were found
dead, some never came back—another missing girl just didn’t have the effect
I thought it would, especially among the females I knew who were the same
age. They were seemingly invincible at seventeen, just as I’m sure Audrey
Barbour and Katherine Latchford and Julie Selwyn and Sarah Johnson had
felt. Our odds looked good: we were young and alive and strong and nothing
could hurt us, and there wasn’t anything clouding this perception, a fable
about our place in the world, and we ignored the intrusive notions of fate and
horror and hideous death that might kidnap us from the golden dome of
adolescence we resided under.
—
THAT WAS THE WEEK I became reminded how astrology affected the
populace, when one of Audrey Barbour’s friends said Audrey’s “rising sign”
indicated “danger perhaps” in the ensuing days after the disappearance, and it
was revealed that Audrey Barbour was a Libra and obsessed with astrology
and wore a gold ankh around her neck, which was visible in the junior
yearbook photo that was printed everywhere. These believers also included
Susan Reynolds and Debbie Schaffer, who both dabbled in Sydney Omarr’s
annual paperback forecasts and often referred to these yearly charts’
confirmation of the luck of certain dates with an alarming frequency—or so I
thought—even though both girls admitted there was a campy element to
astrology they didn’t take too seriously. It was an entertainment, they
stressed. But I also thought, at times, it actually guided them, as well as many
other students in our class: there was, in 1981, an Astrology Club at Buckley.
Other people I knew from that era heavily invested in astrology included my
father, who also believed in biorhythms, which, like astrology, was a kind of
pseudo-science about how our lives were significantly affected by rhythmic
cycles and there was a calculator you had to purchase that prefigured where
your physical and emotional and intellectual states could potentially land
after you entered certain info into the calculator. My father was an atheist and
yet enamored by the religion of astrology and it suggests something about
him that I thought I’d never seen but now realize, writing this, was always
visible: a childlike lostness.
Susan and Debbie bought into the notion that the seventeenth was a
“positive” night to host an event because of something foretold in Susan’s
copy of the Sydney Omarr Cancer forecast for 1981—and yet they never
spoke about the disappearance of Audrey Barbour. The relative positions of
constellations and lunar cycles indicated it had been a bad week for Audrey
Barbour and yet a good week for Susan Reynolds, who was throwing a party
for the boy who, in my mind, had abducted Audrey from a parking lot in
Woodland Hills.

MEXICAN FAN PALMS animated by ground lamps lined the pathway made
of bluestone steps leading up to the tall black-enameled doors of the house on
North Canon Drive, brightly lit, with music faintly emanating from
somewhere behind it. The living room was made up entirely of white marble
and I saw it behind me as I caught a glimpse of myself in a massive giltframed mirror that hung in the foyer. The living room was entirely white—
the couches, the armchairs, the coffee table, the wet bar lined with four
leather stools—and gave off an immaculate sci-fi vibe, as if it was a movie
set no one inhabited. It embodied a starkness that was incongruous with how
friendly both Donald and Gayle Reynolds always seemed to me throughout
the time I’d known Susan, but the house, which they’d moved into three
years ago and which was specifically redesigned by Gayle, suggested
something about Susan’s mother that I’d never quite grasped previously and
Susan had always hinted at: her mother could be a cold bitch. The upstairs of
the house, by comparison, was warmer, even old-fashioned, with plush green
shag carpeting and playful wallpaper and framed posters of movies that
Donald, an entertainment lawyer, had worked on and five homey bedrooms,
which always reminded me that the house was too large and ostentatious for a
family of three—Susan used one of the extra bedrooms as her closet. Donald
and Gayle had departed for Palm Springs on Friday to spend the weekend
with Susan’s grandparents who lived in the Canyon Estates, not far from my
aunt’s house on South Toledo near the Indian Canyons Golf Resort, so the
party that night would be unsupervised by adults, which had begun to seem
necessary as we neared the cusp of becoming seniors that summer. And so far
nothing bad had happened at the parties that weren’t chaperoned by adults.
We had become the chaperones. We were becoming the adults.
—
I MADE MY WAY from the empty living room to the kitchen after
reminding myself the party was taking place in the backyard and passed the
long granite counter lined with tequila bottles where Bruce Johnson and
Nancy Dalloway were busy making margaritas in two blenders and filling
plastic cups rimmed with salt that they placed on a tray Michelle Stevenson
took outside to the backyard. On the kitchen table were the boxes of chopped
salad waiting to be dressed and mixed, along with platters of glistening sushi.
I opened the refrigerator to find a soda but it was almost completely stacked
with Coronas and I didn’t see any Coke or 7Up, and after opting for a beer I
said hi to Bruce and Nancy, who hadn’t noticed me previously, and then
stepped into the backyard. The Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks duet “Stop
Draggin’ My Heart Around” which had been so popular that summer was
playing from outside speakers and there were only about twenty people
standing around and even though it was mid-October you could still sense
traces of night-blooming jasmine, and the massive bougainvillea that sat off
to one side of the yard was now dotted with a multitude of white Christmas
lights and since it was a cool autumn evening the pool was heated and steam
from its surface kept rising upward in tendrils toward the eucalyptus trees
that bordered the brightly lit rectangle of blue water and obscured the
darkened tennis court beyond it.
—
ROBERT MALLORY SIMPLY APPEARED first in my line of vision: like
me, he had gotten a haircut, and was wearing a sky-blue Polo shirt with the
collar up tucked into a pair of tight Calvin Klein jeans and Topsiders. He
stood with Thom and Susan and Jeff and Tracy, and looked so innocent that
his handsomeness was a force, something pure and undeniable—this was a
truth people responded to regardless of what he was hiding. I was again
reminded that I never had a casual reaction when I saw him: I was always
jolted whenever he appeared, fear mingling with lust, horniness blinding me
to the awful possibilities of this person, this form, and it was something I
realized would either go away (which was a lie, because I had similar feelings
about Thom and I’d known him for almost six years) or I’d have to accept
Robert and get used to the fear and desire until we graduated. Thom was
saying something to the group, gesturing with his arms, and this was making
everyone laugh except Susan, who seemed to just smile politely, slightly
dazed, wearing a skirt from Fred Segal and a tight pink Lacoste shirt
accentuating her breasts and unbuttoned so that the deep line of cleavage was
clearly visible. And then Robert was adding onto whatever Thom was saying
and the group laughed again and it sounded real and not fake, as if everyone
had fully bought into the idea of Robert Mallory—the idea he had sold them
on—and I realized I’d been too preoccupied to notice how close they’d all
become in the past few weeks because I was lost in my own daydreams.
I watched Debbie walk out from the opened French doors by the side of
the house, near the laundry room, where a small guest bathroom was located,
lightly wiping her nose, eyes glittering, and joining the group beneath the
massive bougainvillea. I turned away, almost tripping over a silver tub filled
with Coronas lodged in a small mountain of crushed ice.
—
THE PRETENDERS’ “Brass in Pocket” started playing after the Tom Petty
and Stevie Nicks duet—Susan and Debbie had compiled the mixtape played
at the party—and during the first verse I saw Ryan Vaughn sipping a
margarita while standing by the fire pit talking to the two hottest guys in the
junior class, both holding Coronas: Dean McCain, the eleventh-grade
Homecoming King, undeniably handsome with thick wavy brown hair cut
short, a strongly defined jawline and piercing blue eyes and tan complexion,
and Tim Price, another sexy jock from that class, blond-haired and chiseled,
vaguely surferish, both of them straight, but, then, everyone was and
everyone thought Ryan was, so what did it matter if I noticed this thing about
them: maybe they weren’t straight at all, I fantasized, and just faked it like
everyone else was supposed to. I was wondering what Ryan Vaughn was
thinking about Dean McCain as I walked up to them and how he was sizing
him up sexually (there was no way he wasn’t) when they all turned and Ryan
suddenly grabbed me in a playful headlock with one arm and a frozen smile
and growled good-naturedly, “Look who turned up.” He let go of me and I
patted my hair back into place, mildly turned on by how strong he felt, and
with the same frozen smile he said to Dean and Tim, “You know Bret,
right?” They both nodded and said, “Hey, dude.” Ryan didn’t bother
introducing them and they deferred to us because we were seniors and even if
I wasn’t particularly popular this status bestowed upon me a kind of unearned
respect I wouldn’t have received otherwise. Mindless jock banter followed
before Dean and Tim headed off when they saw a group of girls from their
class walking out of the opened doors of the kitchen and into the backyard. I
noticed the flames from the fire pit were wavering in the same direction as
the steam that was drifting off the pool behind Ryan and I focused on that.
Ryan just stood there.
“So you showed up,” I said without looking at him. “You can deal with
this?”
“Yeah, I told you I was going to show up,” Ryan said, somewhat
defensively. “But I’m leaving after I finish my margarita.”
“Yeah, you’re here to support Robert,” I ventured, turning to him.
“Right? Say hello to the birthday boy?”
“Yeah, I said hi.” Ryan shrugged, noncommittally. “I guess, whatever.”
And then he softened slightly. “How you doing?”
“I’m okay,” I said, and then, “I came.”
“Did you hear anything else about Matt?” Ryan asked quietly. “About
what happened? Any other info?”
I stared into his beautiful face, lit orange from the flames of the fire pit,
and just shook my head.
He sipped his margarita. He looked around the yard. He didn’t say
anything. I couldn’t believe Ryan and I had come to this moment when we
simply had nothing to say to each other. I stared at him, wonderingly, almost
daring him to stare back: what had happened to the person I spent that
weekend with in the empty house on Mulholland and whose body I explored
so relentlessly, while we hungrily and endlessly kissed and licked and sucked
until our lips and chins were chafed and our tongues were sore? He looked
back at me and both of us silently assessed each other. The staring became a
kind of comic dare and we tried not to smile until Ryan finally made the
What’s up? face we used to share and a pathetic relief washed over me and I
laughed but didn’t make the face back. Ryan relaxed and was studying me
while every so often glancing at the group on the other side of the yard.
“So what’s going on?” he asked. “What’s happening? You and Debbie
okay?”
“Yeah, well,” was all I said.
“That’s what I thought,” he said.
“You’re doing okay?” I asked.
“Oh yeah, I’m fine,” he said with a breezy confidence I envied. “Just
biding my time, just smiling and biding my time.”
“Biding your time until?” I asked. He let the question hang between us
longer than I thought he would. And I realized he knew what I knew he
meant—this secret between us—his longing to get out of Buckley and move
away from everything. Sustain the illusion for another year, until graduation,
when he would finally be free.
“You know,” he started, “you don’t have to make things so difficult,” he
said, in a low and soothing voice, almost as if he was a salesman letting me in
on a secret about how I could get a better deal. “It’s not that hard.”
“What do you mean?” I asked, suddenly embarrassed but too curious to
stop from asking. “What do I make too difficult?”
“You need to relax, take it easy,” Ryan said. “You don’t have to make
things so difficult for yourself. For whatever’s happening.”
“What’s happening?” I asked.
Ryan rolled his eyes and shook his head. “Forget it. I don’t want to talk
about it here.”
“No, I want to know what you mean.”
“No, you don’t,” he said. “You want to turn everything into a drama.”
“I don’t, I really don’t,” I stressed. “Have I been doing that? Have I been
turning everything into a drama?”
“I think it’s something you can’t help,” he said. “Look, I don’t want to
talk about this here.”
“You’ve been avoiding me, and I’m…okay with that, I guess,” I said.
“But I kind of want to know why.”
“See. This is the problem,” he said. “I haven’t been avoiding you.”
“Bullshit,” I said. “We used to be a lot closer.”
He flinched and quickly scanned the backyard to see if anyone had heard
me but the grounds were vast and we were far away from anyone else and the
party had gotten larger and a louder song started playing—“Planet Claire” by
the B-52s suddenly announced itself.
“But I’m the same person,” he said. “I’m the same person I’ve always
been. And that you’ve always known. Nothing’s changed.” He paused. “And
yet you think I have changed.” He paused again. “That’s kind of the
problem.”
“But you have changed, Ryan,” I said in a low steely voice, averting his
stare by looking over at the flames of the fire pit. “You’re no longer friends
with me.”
“Why would you think that?” he asked. “I really don’t want to have this
conversation here, Bret.” He said this as a warning and scanned the yard
again. He noticed that Debbie Schaffer realized I was here and excused
herself from Thom and Susan and Robert and started making her way over to
the fire pit. “Jesus,” Ryan muttered and downed the rest of the margarita.
“Look, I am your friend. I’m closer to you than just about anybody else in
this fucking place. But whatever you think was going to happen just can’t.
I’m not saying something won’t happen again but I can’t get involved in your
drama. Whatever your, I don’t know, expectations are.” He looked at me
blank-faced when he said this in order to make a point. “I don’t want to hurt
you.”
“Okay, okay,” I said. “I understand. I’m sorry.”
“Cool,” he said, smiling at Debbie as she immediately kissed me openmouthed, deeply, a lingering French kiss that I went with in front of Ryan.
“Hey, handsome,” she said, smiling, pulling back, wasted already. Sometimes
cocaine made Debbie tight and jittery, her body tensed with the pleasure the
drug gave her, and other times, depending on the coke, she might act slightly
sloppy, as if she was drunk on four vodkas instead of simply high. She was
wearing a plaid miniskirt and a button-down Polo shirt with a Camp Beverly
Hills sweater tied across her shoulders. “Whoa,” I finally said, pretending to
be stunned by the kiss. There was a silence and then Ryan started laughing
and then I started laughing and finally Debbie started laughing, but she was
confused as to why we were all laughing. “That was quite a greeting,” Ryan
explained, good-naturedly. Debbie pushed into me. “I can’t help it,” she said.
“He drives me crazy.” I placed an arm around her waist, wanting Ryan to
notice. “When did you get here?” she asked me. “Why didn’t you come say
hi?”
“Just a few minutes ago,” I said. “Ryan waved me over,” I lied. “How’s
everything going? The place looks great.” Ryan wasn’t looking at me any
longer—he had finished the margarita and was planning his escape.
“Fabulous,” Debbie intoned theatrically. She suddenly looked from me
to Ryan. “Hey.” She wanted his attention. He looked back at her. “Does
anyone want a bump?” she asked casually.
Ryan immediately shook his head. “No, I’m fine.”
Debbie turned to me. I pretended to be conflicted until I said, “Maybe
later.”
“Okay,” she said. “Just let me know,” she whispered into my ear before
she kissed it, tonguing the lobe, lingering. Ryan stared at the two of us
amused, as if he thought we were daring him into a reaction.
—
AND THEN WE noticed Thom and Susan and Robert walking to where we
stood. Susan floated between them in the semi-darkness of the backyard as
“Clubland” started playing over the party—I’ll always remember that
moment, her movements somehow synched with that particular song and its
inherent drama and Elvis Costello’s voice, that beautiful numbness radiating
out of her—that enviable detachment—and she had never looked more
desirable, especially when her face neared mine in the wavering flames of the
fire pit and she kissed my cheek. “I’m happy you’re here,” she said, her
breasts grazing my chest. “I’m glad you made it.”
I suspected she was high but you could never really tell with Susan: she
might do a line or two and act just as casually as if she had sipped a Perrier;
she never got wired like Debbie.
“Hey, man,” Thom said, only a little wasted on tequila.
Robert greeted me with that strange wave he’d sometimes offer,
suggesting he was dealing with a child, I always thought, and I don’t think
I’d ever seen him make this gesture to anyone else. I offered my hand and he
looked at it questioningly before taking it.
We shook and as I pulled back I said, “Congratulations.”
He stalled briefly, the mania now whirring behind the eyes, and said,
somewhat confused but not wanting to pursue what I meant, “Thanks.”
I just wanted to fuck with him—no one else noticed the exchange
because everyone was murmuring how cool the party was and how great the
yard looked and Robert turned away and started nodding his approval and
then Thom and Ryan were talking about an upcoming game and then the
oddest exchange happened: Michelle Stevenson walked over with a tray of
margaritas, and though I declined, Debbie took one as did Susan, and when
Robert reached for a plastic cup rimmed with salt and garnished with a lime
slice, Susan quietly said, “You shouldn’t be drinking that—I thought you
weren’t going to drink.”
I was so shocked by the simple intimacy of the comment that I barely
registered it when Robert shrugged and said, “I’ll be okay, babe.” The way he
said “babe” confirmed something I didn’t want to confront that night, and as
Robert chugged the margarita the girls turned away and Debbie said
something about maybe hitting the beach this week, after school one day,
before Thom left to look at colleges back east—he was flying to New York
on Friday. Thom heard this and turned away from Ryan and said that
sounded totally awesome—the beach, let’s do it—and a plan formed while
Susan explained to Robert where the Jonathan Club was and how everyone’s
father was a member, except for Terry Schaffer—but Terry, Debbie told us,
was throwing a party in two weeks, and we were all invited, and she
mentioned the stars who were dropping by: Sigourney Weaver, Mel Gibson,
Jane Fonda, Richard Gere, Chris Reeve.
—
I WAS MOSTLY WATCHING Ryan’s face while this conversation played
(his father wasn’t a member of the Jonathan Club either) and since I knew
exactly what he thought about everyone—Thom was a spoiled wuss, Debbie
was clueless, Susan was entitled, he’d wanted to suck Robert’s cock and then
fuck him in the ass—something within me started churning with sympathy
for Ryan Vaughn even though he had rejected me and when everyone
decided to head into the kitchen for sushi and another margarita I felt that
familiar pang as Ryan said he had to leave and get back to Northridge. I was
the only one who understood this was what Ryan actually preferred. It was a
Saturday night. There wasn’t a curfew. He wasn’t secretly meeting friends to
catch a movie in Westwood. No one was waiting for him at home. He wanted
to leave the party and the house on North Canon Drive. Thom made
exaggerated attempts to get him to stay and there was a general protest from
the rest of the group but not from me. Ryan eventually said good night as
people began to circle the table in the crowded kitchen and served themselves
—though it seemed only the guys were hungry, with Thom and Robert and
Jeff piling their plates with chopped salad and handfuls of sushi, while the
girls sipped their drinks and chatted among themselves.
I waited for a beat and when the group was busy pouring themselves
fresh margaritas from one of the blenders Bruce Johnson was still manning—
he was high on coke as well, I’d find out later, and into the idea of being that
night’s bartender—I slipped away and walked quickly through the backyard
beneath the bougainvillea tree and onto a pathway that lined the side of the
house and then across the front lawn toward North Canon Drive, where Ryan
was already sitting in the Trans Am—the engine was running, the headlights
were on, I could hear Bob Seger singing “Beautiful Loser”—and I tried to
open the passenger door but it was locked and when I crouched down and
rapped on the window, Ryan turned to see who it was and his expression
became creased with concern and he shook his head twice—no—and pushed
the car into drive and quickly glided away from the curb.
—
IN THE KITCHEN I GRABBED a margarita and then passed by the adjacent
dining room, where I glimpsed Thom and Susan and Jeff and Tracy but
couldn’t see enough of the room to know if Robert and Debbie had joined
them, and then I walked outside and moved through the expanding crowd
hanging on the lawn—“Mirror in the Bathroom” by the English Beat echoed
over the yard—and headed toward the darkened tennis court, where I pulled
out a pack of Marlboros I brought for the party and lit a cigarette while
wandering back and forth along the net, sipping the margarita and
contemplating my place in the world and wondered where Audrey Barbour
was, the week after she disappeared from the Promenade parking lot in
Woodland Hills. From where I was hidden I had a full view of the lawn
beyond the steaming pool and into the house and both the downstairs and the
upstairs were flooded with light. It seemed that by nine o’clock the entire
senior class had arrived along with a disproportionate amount of the junior
class and the kids I didn’t recognize were, I guessed, from other private
schools in the city—girls Susan and Debbie knew from Corvallis and
Westlake and guys who Thom knew from Harvard and Beverly. Thom and
Dominic and Jeff were standing before a half-circle of girls while people kept
walking up to Robert Mallory, who was standing beside the Buckley crew, to
shake his hand and say “Hi” before engaging in the small talk I so dreaded
and then moving off so another person or couple could replace them, coming
up to Robert and saying “Hey” and repeating the ritual that had just
transpired moments earlier, as if they were all introducing themselves to him,
or in some cases reintroducing themselves.
At one point this seemed so fake that it became legitimately
disconcerting and I had to look away. Susan’s knowing that Robert shouldn’t
be drinking suggested to me that this was somehow connected to his
problems from the past—the mental institution he’d spent time in—and yet
obviously it wasn’t bad enough for her to actively discourage it: Robert drank
the margarita anyway.
—
AND WHEN I LOOKED back I noticed that Robert was drinking another
margarita and that once it was finished he was looking around for whoever
was passing them until a group of younger girls that I didn’t recognize
interrupted him and looked as if they were nervously approaching a movie
star about to ask for his autograph. The backyard was now packed and as I
crouched on the darkened tennis court the party became permeated with the
smell of marijuana; from where I was hiding I could actually see a haze of
smoke float over the crowd and just hang there as if a light fog bank had
descended above the backyard. And inside the house lines were forming for
the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen and the one by the laundry room—kids
in groups of three and four squeezing into the small guest bathrooms to share
coke. I smoked another cigarette, masked by the darkness, and kept watching
the house, trying to forget about Ryan and my useless feelings for him—I had
gotten a haircut for him, I thought I looked hot, nothing mattered—and
realized that what I felt wasn’t sadness anymore but a rising anger.
—
WHEN MY EYES LANDED ON Thom and Dominic and Jeff I noticed that
Debbie had interrupted whoever Robert was talking to—Robert was buzzed
and gesturing excitedly with the hand holding a fresh margarita sloshing over
the rim—and Debbie whispered something in his ear that caused him to
freeze and then nod. “Gates of Steel” by Devo began playing as Robert
excused himself from the group and let Debbie guide him through the crowd
to where the French doors of the dining room opened into the house. Robert
kept leaning in to her, asking things or explaining something, while he
followed her out of the kitchen and disappeared from my sight. I stayed fixed
on the house, wondering where they were going; then I suddenly looked
upward and saw Susan standing by the window in her parents’ bedroom,
partly hidden in silhouette, partially lit by the lamp on the bedside nightstand.
She was staring down at the party and I imagined she was looking at Thom,
who was craning his neck searching for someone, interrupted by a high-five.
I also knew the following was about to happen and waited impatiently until it
occurred: the door of the bedroom opened and Debbie and Robert appeared
and then Debbie turned and locked the door behind her. Susan immediately
walked over to Robert, who just stood by an armoire, staring at Susan as she
took the half-empty margarita out of his hand while Debbie sat on the side of
the bed and pulled out a small packet from her skirt and tapped out a line on
the nightstand. Susan was standing too close to Robert and whatever she was
telling him caused his face to slacken with exaggerated disbelief and then he
was gesturing to himself as if he was creating a manic defense against
whatever Susan was accusing him of. And then he tried to touch her face.
—
I LOOKED BACK AT Debbie but she had leaned over the nightstand and I
couldn’t see her. Susan had paced away from Robert, her arms crossed,
shaking her head, pissed. But then Robert said something that caused Susan
to turn around and after a beat she started laughing, because Robert, I
guessed, had disarmed her, and then I looked over to Debbie, who had sat up
and was wiping her nose while laughing too. And then I watched as Robert
walked over to Susan and gently touched her arm and explained something to
her and then she said something and he nodded. Debbie stood up and was
listening to them until Susan jokingly pushed Robert away and then Debbie
started walking toward the door, and Susan and Robert followed her, moving
out into the upstairs hallway, and then the door closed. That was it. Nothing
else happened. Robert didn’t stroke Susan’s face. They didn’t kiss. And
nothing that I witnessed from my vantage point on the darkened tennis court
seemed as intimate as that one line Susan said: You shouldn’t be drinking that
—I thought you weren’t going to drink. And yet a narrative about Susan and
Robert confirmed itself to me that night when I watched them interact in her
parents’ bedroom.
Wasn’t there a moment when I would have been in Don and Gayle’s
master bedroom over the summer, just a few months ago, and I’d be sharing a
couple of lines with Debbie Schaffer and Susan Reynolds instead of Robert
Mallory? And now I wasn’t. I had been replaced. Nothing mattered anymore.
It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. I finished the margarita in
one gulp—it was strong, my eyes watered, peace briefly blanketed over me
and then disappeared. Oh, Vienna. When I looked back at the yard my eyes
landed on Thom Wright, who was still distracted, scanning the party. There
would only be one person he was looking for: Susan. His girlfriend. Thom
stood on his toes to get a better view around the yard but she wasn’t there.
—
I JUST TURNED AWAY AND HID in the darkness of the tennis court,
where I kept smoking cigarettes and putting them out in the empty plastic
cup. I was muttering to myself while walking along the length of the net
when I heard my name over the sounds of the distant party. “Bret?” I heard it
again. I looked up. There was a shadow standing beneath one of the
eucalyptus trees that bordered the court. “What are you doing here?” the
voice asked. Something in me deflated and yet I took a deep breath and
summoned the tangible participant. “Are you okay?” It was Debbie. I later
found out that she’d been looking for me and had actually gone outside to
Canon Drive, where she located my car still parked at the curb and quickly
checked the house until she surmised I’d drifted away from the party and was
alone somewhere and that’s when she decided the pool or the darkened tennis
court was where I’d be.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” I said. “I was just having a cigarette?” It came out like
a question.
“What are you doing here?” she asked again. “In the dark?”
“I just wanted to…take a break,” I said.
“Take a break from what?” I heard her ask. She was still a shadow, just a
voice.
“From the party,” I said monotonously.
“Why would you want to take a break from the party?” she asked.
“Because I wanted to,” I said with a slight tinge of defiance.
“Is something wrong with the party?” she asked.
At this point I thought she was purposefully fucking with me and I got
pissed. And then I realized there was no other option except to approach this
scene with an optimism that I might have lacked but knew I could fake. She
appeared out of the darkness and was now visible. I turned to see if Thom
had found Susan yet but he was semi-obscured behind the thick sheets of
steam coming up off the pool.
“No, the party is great,” I said, smiling, turning around. “You guys did a
great job. Who decorated the tree? The white lights. The sushi. The
mixtape…” I trailed off.
“You don’t look like you’re having fun,” she said. And then, “But you
never really do.”
“That’s not…true,” I started. “Debbie, I…”
I don’t know what I was going to confess—certainly nothing about her
dad, because whatever happened with Terry had nothing to do with her or
anything else, and this was true of Ryan Vaughn and Matt Kellner as well. I
just wanted to explain myself in some vague way that Debbie Schaffer could
grasp and finally understand that I never wanted to hurt her—just like Ryan
Vaughn didn’t want to hurt me—and that I was as lost as anyone she knew
and this was fucking me up and that she deserved so much better than this
seventeen-year-old zombie who was pretending to be someone he wasn’t. But
I couldn’t form the words because I saw a future that seemed even more
desolate than the present I was trapped in if I admitted any of this. Debbie
kept moving closer and it appeared as if my presence had a calming effect:
she didn’t seem jittery or high and I thought maybe she’d taken a few hits off
one of the joints it seemed everyone was passing around, but I realized she
was simply calm because she’d found me. She asked for a cigarette and I
offered her the pack of Marlboros and then she leaned in and I lit the tip. She
inhaled, then exhaled. She looked up at the night sky bordered by the glossy
green leaves of the eucalyptus trees and then past me at the party on the
packed lawn. “Tainted Love” by Soft Cell was playing—we all owned the
U.K. import—and she asked if I wanted some coke. I didn’t. She handed me
the cigarette and then pulled out a baggie from the pocket in her skirt and
with the pearled nail of her index finger snorted a bump.
“What were you all doing upstairs?” I asked, watching her.
“Who?” Debbie asked, startled.
“You and Susan and Robert.”
“How did you know—” She looked over at the house and realized that
from my vantage point I could easily see into Don and Gayle’s bedroom. It
was a tiny moment but Debbie had to compose herself because of my
question. “Were you spying on us?” she asked, taking the cigarette back from
me.
“Yes,” I said. “I’m always spying on you.”
“That’s not very nice,” she said, teasingly. “But it’s kind of sexy.”
“What were you guys doing upstairs?”
Debbie quickly made a decision, because what lie could she tell me? I
had watched the entire scene even though I hadn’t heard it.
“Well, Susan was upset about something—”
“What?” I interrupted. “What was she upset about?”
Debbie looked at me curiously, and then took another drag off the
cigarette. “She was upset because Robert was—Robert is—drinking too
much tonight. That’s all.”
“Why would Susan care if Robert was drinking too much?” I asked.
“Well,” Debbie started, “it seems that Robert is taking…” She stopped.
“…some medicine and it might not interact well with alcohol.”
“What kind of medicine?” I asked. “For what?”
“I…don’t really know,” Debbie said.
“Really?” I asked. “You don’t know? You don’t know what kind of
medicine Robert is taking?”
“Why do you care?” she asked. “Why do you care what kind of medicine
Robert takes? What difference could it possibly make to you?”
I didn’t say anything, just stared at her, and she met my gaze and kept it.
“And…?” I let the word hang there. “Is that your answer?”
“Are you trying to ask me something?” Debbie said. “Because if you are:
just say it. Don’t play this stupid game with me.”
“I’m just asking what’s going on,” I said, casually. “I just wanted to
know why you had to bring Robert upstairs to Susan.” I paused. “Why
couldn’t she get him herself?” I paused again. “Was it because Thom was
there?” I asked.
“I didn’t have to ‘do’ anything, Bret,” Debbie said. “You’re turning
something into something it’s not.” She paused. “It’s not a big deal.”
“I just asked a question,” I said. I looked back at the party.
In a break from the steam rising off the pool I glimpsed Thom craning
his neck, distracted, not listening to the voices surrounding him—he still
couldn’t locate Susan in the crowd. I scanned the party and didn’t locate
Robert either. They were both somewhere inside the house, maybe talking,
maybe leaning in to each other, maybe Susan was quietly pleading with him
not to drink another margarita, maybe Robert was assuring her he’d be okay;
Kiss me, one of them was saying. I was becoming angry and I didn’t want to
lay it out on Debbie so I just said, “Let’s go.” I paused before I muttered,
“This is fucking ridiculous.”
“So now you want to go back to the party?” she said, sighing, as if she
hadn’t heard me. “After I’ve got you all to myself you want to go back to the
party? Jeez, Bret.”
“Yeah,” I said, ignoring what she insinuated. “I want another margarita.”
My fury consumed me and I was going to tamp it down with tequila—
there was no option except to get drunk. Debbie saw where I put the
cigarettes out and crushed hers in the same empty cup. And then she walked
up to me before I turned away and kissed my mouth. I expected it. I steeled
myself. But I didn’t push her away—I simply let her kiss me and it only took
a few seconds until I kissed her back, suddenly overwhelmed with horniness,
and I realized it had been building all night, ever since I saw Ryan talking to
Dean McCain and Tim Price and probably even before that, when I was again
reminded how handsome Robert Mallory was and how I had always loved
Thom Wright and suddenly it wouldn’t have mattered who was kissing me on
the darkened tennis court—I would have fucked anybody in that moment,
boy or girl, old or young, handsome or ugly. Debbie murmured her surprise
at how passionate I’d become and it shocked her when I pulled her face away
from mine, roughly clutching a handful of hair in a fist, and this activated
something and she immediately fell to her knees and we both unzipped my
jeans and pulled out my cock, which was aching—I realized I hadn’t jerked
off in days—and when she began swallowing it expertly a kind of relief
spiraled through me.
Debbie wasn’t high enough to be completely impractical and just have
me fuck her on the green asphalt—though if she kept blowing me I would’ve
come easily in the next minute—and she pulled me even farther into the
darkness on the other side of the tennis court, where we tumbled onto an
inflatable raft, a pool toy, and I couldn’t believe how hard I was. My erection
was sticking up out of my jeans like some kind of absurd fertility symbol, and
yet I realized that rage was what excited me—and it was aimed at everyone:
it was directed at Robert Mallory, of course, but it was also directed at Thom
Wright, who had let Robert become his friend while I was slipping away, and
it was directed at Susan and at Ryan and at Buckley, and maybe in that
moment it was directed at Terry Schaffer, but mostly it was directed at myself
and the futility I was feeling, fed with images of imagined sex with Thom and
Robert that would never happen or the reality of the sex that I experienced
with Ryan and Matt and that was never going to repeat itself. Everything that
had once given me hope was taken away and this was tied to the rage I was
unfairly directing at Debbie.
—
BUT SHE LIKED IT. She enjoyed herself. I had never fucked her like this
before. Lying on the raft, she had slipped off her panties and raised the
miniskirt—I just pulled my jeans down to my knees and she was so wet I
easily slid in. It lasted barely two minutes, during which she came twice and I
just kept fucking her, just ramming my cock in, cursing until I exploded
inside her and immediately collapsed, panting, the rage finally diminishing.
“Jesus,” she muttered. “Where did that come from? Fuck.” I rolled off her
and half fell off the raft, still panting, my dick hard and wet and sticking up. I
felt like I was burning. I couldn’t catch my breath. My heart was beating so
fast. She was laughing with relief—this had proven something to her: I really
was her boyfriend. I really liked her. I had desired her so badly and in ways
she never supposed—the fuck was the proof. As I pushed myself up off the
raft I could clearly hear “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)” and realized that
the din of the party had quieted down—only the song played, no one was
talking. And then I heard someone yelling. It was Thom Wright’s voice,
which had somehow silenced the hum of the crowd. I moved hesitantly
toward the pool and Debbie walked over to where I was standing and
suddenly cursed when she saw Thom leaning over Susan—he didn’t seem
wasted, just racked with fury. Everyone at the party was silent and staring at
them.
“Where were you?” he was shouting. “I asked you where you were?”
“Stop screaming at me!” Susan shouted back.
“Where were you, Susan?”
“You’re drunk,” Susan shouted. “Stop it.”
“Where in the fuck were you, babe?” Thom was red-faced, standing over
Susan in a threatening stance. I had never seen Thom Wright this angry
before—it didn’t connect with the boy I’d grown up with. Jeff Taylor was
whispering in Thom’s ear, trying to pull him back.
“I was in the fucking house!” Susan was shouting.
“With who?” Thom yelled. “Doing what?”
“With Debbie, you fucking idiot,” she screamed. “What does it fucking
matter?”
“You’re lying!” he shouted. “You’re a liar. You lie. You lie all the time
now!”
Debbie rushed away from me and across the darkened tennis court, then
along the side of the lit pool, until she was on the lawn, pushing through the
party. I pulled up my jeans and then slowly moved forward, suddenly
exhausted from the sex, my Topsiders trudging across the asphalt until I
reached the edge of the pool.
“Thom, stop it!” Susan was shouting. “You’re being such an asshole.”
“When did you become such a bitch?” Thom yelled. “Why have you
become such a fucking bitch?”
“You’re being ridiculous,” Susan said.
“I’m not being ridiculous,” Thom shouted.
“You’re drunk!” she shouted back. “You’re wasted!”
“Fuck you!” Thom suddenly roared. “Fuck you, Susan! Tell me where
the fuck you were?”
“What do you fucking want from me?” Susan cried out.
Debbie appeared and said something to Susan as she pulled her away
from Thom, who was struggling with Jeff and Dominic, and then I froze as I
watched Robert Mallory walk up to Thom. Robert’s presence seemed to
momentarily relax him while Debbie ushered Susan into the house. Robert
eased Thom away from Jeff and Dominic and then the four of them were
walking toward the pool, the crowd parting for the quartet of guys. Thom was
muttering, shaking his head, a clearly wasted Robert whispering in his ear as
the four of them crossed the lawn. My gaze shifted to Debbie conferring with
Susan in the kitchen as other girls surrounded them—Susan tossed back a
margarita that Michelle handed her. By the fire pit Robert drunkenly hugged
Thom, with Jeff and Dominic briefly acting as sentries to ward anyone away.
—
“RESPECTABLE STREET” BY XTC started playing and the collective
voice of the party hesitantly sounded up again once the actors in this
particular drama had exited the stage. Thom collapsed on a chaise by the
pool, Robert leaning over and murmuring to him as Thom nodded, and I
noted the way Robert’s hand was rubbing Thom’s shoulder, and then
Anthony and Doug walked over with a tray of margaritas and a full bottle of
tequila. I couldn’t hear what anyone was saying from where I stood in the
darkness on the edge of the tennis court. I might have remained hidden for
the rest of the party but there was something unbearable about the way
Robert was touching Thom and how close he was to him that enraged me.
And I quickly revealed myself, walking over to the group of guys lounging
on the chaises by the pool. I ignored everyone but Thom and Robert and
stood over them and asked hollowly, “Is everything okay?”
It was Robert who turned to me and said, “Yeah, everything’s okay,
Bret.”
But I wasn’t looking at him. I was staring down at Thom, who finally
looked up at me, smiling sadly.
Jeff and Dominic, and Anthony and Doug, stopped talking and everyone
waited for Thom to say something.
And then Thom apologized and started rambling. It was Susan’s party.
She had to deal with guests. Thom was on edge. He overreacted. He probably
drank too much. He did a line. But I could barely hear what Thom was saying
because Robert was sitting so close to him on the chaise and I wondered if I
had ever sat that close to Thom Wright. Had he ever let me? Had I ever dared
myself? Their thighs were pressing against each other. Thom kept talking and
I intuitively looked over at Robert, who was now staring at me. There was
something off—he wasn’t as in control or fake: his eyes were half closed and
he was loose, tired, woozy. He was looking past me and when I turned I
watched as Susan and Debbie made their way across the lawn to the edge of
the pool. I turned back, distracted by Robert pushing himself up and falling
into a nearby patio chair, presumably to make room for Susan. And then
Thom was looking up at Susan and reached out a hand and Susan
automatically took it and crouched down and they lightly kissed, quietly
apologizing to each other, and I could feel everyone relaxing as Susan sat
next to Thom in the space where Robert had been sitting. I downed the
margarita I was clutching in one gulp and then reached for another.
—
EVERYONE GOT WASTED that night. A group had formed around the
King and Queen, and Bruce Johnson and Michelle brought out more
margaritas, and then Kyle Colson and David O’Shea and Kevin Kerslake
joined us, along with Tracy and Katie and Rita Lee, and cocaine was being
openly passed around in small packets. A phone call had been made and
someone met a dealer in front of the house on Canon around midnight and
stronger margaritas were blended to go with the coke and I sat with Debbie
on my lap—she was purring with happiness about the fuck we shared earlier
—and after my third margarita I was drunk enough and decided to do a
couple of bumps and kept a small packet Debbie handed me so I could
sustain my high uninterrupted—the supply was seemingly endless. Thom had
only done another line—that’s all he needed—but Susan, lying next to him
on the chaise, was calmly doing small bumps every five minutes,
occasionally inhaling on a clove cigarette, which I knew Thom didn’t like—
she usually refrained from smoking around him but not that night. Robert had
been slumped in a chair next to them and he was one of the few people not
partaking in the coke because of the “medication” he was supposedly
prescribed, even though he was already hammered. At a certain point I
noticed he’d disappeared while I was engaged in a nonsensical conversation
with Jeff and Tracy.
Someone making whooping noises startled us, and it took a moment to
realize they were coming from Robert, dashing out of the pool house and
stumbling toward the lit block of water. Robert had discarded his jeans and
he was pulling the Polo shirt over his head and only in his jockey shorts by
the time he stood at the edge of the pool. And then he stepped out of the
jockey shorts and was completely naked—this was the first time I’d seen
Robert’s body and though I only glimpsed it quickly I was paralyzed: it was
exactly as I imagined in my fantasies. Tan except for the whiteness across his
thighs and ass, Robert had a similar build to Thom and Ryan, the body of an
athlete, tall and broad-shouldered, lightly sculpted with defined pectorals and
a flat tier of abs lowering to his penis, which was long and thick and pink
with a bush of brown hair above it. Robert cannonballed into the pool and
swam sloppily to the shallow end, where he stumbled up the steps and
padded over to the diving board, completely wet and naked, and I homed in
on his tight, smooth ass and I was suddenly unable to breathe. He dived in
again. Thom and Jeff were laughing but Debbie had shifted on my lap and
said “Susan” as if it was a warning but Susan had already stood up and was
watching with a concerned expression. Thom and Jeff stopped laughing when
they watched Robert just splashing around in the middle of the pool, flailing
incoherently, smacking the water with his arms in what seemed like a
drunken, spastic rage, steam billowing around him.
And that was the moment when everyone realized this wasn’t a joke:
there was something wrong with Robert.
Susan said quietly, “Thom, will you get him out of the pool.” It wasn’t a
question—it was an urgent demand.
Thom looked up at her, confused.
“Do something, Thom,” Susan said. “Get him out of there. He’s wasted.
He’s going to hurt himself.”
Robert disappeared under the water and wasn’t coming up for air. Thom
finally realized something serious was happening but didn’t know what
exactly—just that this went beyond a drunken joke. He staggered up and
kicked his shoes off and pulled his shirt over his head and quickly unzipped
and stepped out of his jeans. The body I had glanced at in the locker room all
these years was more noticeably muscled because of football season: lighter
and leaner. Only wearing the plaid Polo boxers Thom now favored, high and
tight, accentuating his thighs and ass. I watched as Thom walked quickly to
the pool’s shallow end, where he waded in and then dived under the water
and swam to Robert, pulling him off the floor, where Robert had sunk, and up
to the surface, and though it looked as if they were struggling, Robert seemed
lost in another world, the whooping sounds replaced with gibberish,
something incomprehensible, and he kept splashing water at Thom, who was
reaching out to him, smiling as he tried to get Robert calm enough to follow
him out of the pool. And then Robert went underwater again.
“Is he okay?” I remember Jeff asking.
“I told him not to drink,” Susan said quietly, still staring at the pool.
“He’s on Thorazine and three other medications.” I looked at her after she
murmured this to herself.
—
THOM DIVED to pull Robert up and dragged him to the surface again. But
he kept struggling with Robert, who giggled maniacally and splashed at the
steaming pool as if he was impersonating an angry child, and soon Thom was
getting on Robert’s level so he’d follow Thom out of the pool, by splashing
along with him. With a growing impatience Susan watched this game Thom
was now playing until she snapped.
“Jesus,” she muttered, and unzipped her skirt and pulled off the Lacoste
and in just bra and panties walked steadily toward the pool to help guide
Robert out. Something in me shrank as I realized she cared enough about
Robert Mallory and his insanity to strip down in front of us and help rescue
him from her own pool, and I shuddered and quickly downed what was left of
my margarita. Debbie removed herself from my lap and stood next to the
chair I was sitting in and watched the pool intently. Thom brought Robert to
the surface again, his arms wrapped around his chest, Thom’s biceps bulging
with the effort, as Robert kept pounding the water with his fists—something
primal was happening that he wanted to express. When Thom noticed Susan
in just her panties and bra walking down the steps into the shallow end, he
groaned, “Aw, come on, babe, I got this, put your clothes back on.” Susan
ignored him and waded into the warm water, moving quickly over to where
Thom was embracing Robert, and when Robert saw Susan he stopped
struggling and stared at her with what seemed like drunken wonderment,
suddenly babbling about how pretty she was, and then Robert looked at
Thom and told Thom how handsome he was and that he was such a beautiful
dude. “Come on, buddy, you need to get to bed,” was Thom’s response. “We
need to get you out of this pool.”
I kept noticing the way Thom’s biceps were bulging with the effort it
took to steady Robert as Susan neared them and then Robert stopped
struggling for a moment, as if stunned by the sight. And as Robert stared at
Susan he became immobile, which allowed Thom’s grip to loosen, and then
both Thom and Susan were guiding Robert out of the pool as he kept turning
to each of them, babbling nonsensically. At one point Robert tried to kiss
Susan, who pulled back, and when Robert suddenly turned to Thom and tried
to kiss him Thom didn’t pull back fast enough, letting Robert’s mouth make
contact with his but Thom took it in stride, laughing. “Come on, buddy,”
Thom said. “Let’s get you outta here.” Robert kept trying to kiss both of
them, turning from one to the other, as they guided him toward the steps that
led out of the pool, and soon both Susan and Thom were just letting Robert
kiss their mouths, their faces, because it was easier than fighting him—he
was finally relaxed.
Thom kept laughing and Susan seemed annoyed. The kissing didn’t carry
a sexual vibe because Robert was too wasted to distinguish them; they were
both the same to Robert in that moment, and since the goal was to get Robert
out of the pool without any hassle they just let him keep kissing them, as if he
was a puppy, eagerly licking one face and then the other, desperately
searching for affection from either Thom or Susan. (Robert’s mouth
repeatedly making contact with Thom’s has remained an indelible image
during the rest of my life.) Robert limply put both arms over Susan’s and
Thom’s shoulders as they helped walk him up the steps and out of the pool.
Robert slipped, pulling both Susan and Thom down with him, and then they
were crouching over his prone body. Robert was on his back, totally naked,
his legs spread, his knees slightly raised, and I was focused below the tight
ball-sack, where the crack of his ass was visible, and Susan told Thom, “Get
a towel.” And Thom asked, “What? Where?” looking utterly confused.
“They’re over there,” Susan said harshly, gesturing. Robert lying on the wet
concrete was in a trance, shivering, lost and naked, an exhausted child. “Take
him into the house, Thom,” Susan quietly commanded after Thom trotted
over with a beach towel he draped over Robert and then leaned down and
easily lifted Robert up, quickly carrying him across the lawn into the kitchen.
He had already passed out by the time Thom placed him on the couch in the
living room.
—
SUSAN STOOD AT THE EDGE of the pool, wet, her bra and panties now
translucent because of the water that stained them, her breasts and pubic hair
clearly visible, and she grabbed a towel and wrapped it around herself and
silently followed Thom as if she was ashamed about what had happened.
Debbie and Jeff and Tracy realized the night was over: from Robert diving
into the pool until Thom carrying him into the house took only a few minutes
and it was the catalyst for the party to end. I finally kissed Debbie goodbye
and assured her I was sober enough to drive home and raced through the
canyons to the empty house on Mulholland, where I took two Valium and
tumbled into sleep. I later heard that Thom passed out in Susan’s bed, and
Tracy and Jeff fell asleep in the guest room, and Robert slept through the
night on the white couch in the living room, huddled in blankets that Susan
had arrayed over him while she and Debbie stayed up doing the rest of the
coke and cleaning the house, and occasionally keeping an eye on Robert,
who, according to Debbie the following day, didn’t stop shivering, and
occasionally moaning, lost in what seemed like an endless flow of
nightmares.

IF I COULD PINPOINT THE BREAK, the collapse, the reordering of our
world, I remember an afternoon on the beach at the Jonathan Club in October
of 1981 as the beginning of the end to something. The secret story about Matt
was my loss of innocence, my first moment of adulthood and death, and I
never moved through life again unaffected by the trauma this caused,
everything changed because of it, and, even more painfully, I realized—and
this was the truer, starker loss—that there was nothing I could do. This was
life, this was death, nobody cared in the end, we were alone. And so, in some
ways, Ronald Kellner’s office on Haskell Avenue is the crux—everything
leads up to it, everything falls away after it. On that cold day at the beach
club the narrative sped up and I began to see more clearly what was about to
subsume us—where the probable outcome was going to land.
—
WE HAD DECIDED to take Robert to the beach club before school let out
on Thursday afternoon, the day before Thom left to look at colleges back
east. When we proposed this to Robert on Wednesday he agreed eagerly—
any reminder of what happened Saturday night seemed to have been
eradicated by Monday morning, when I first saw him at assembly in the
courtyard, mingling with classmates and grinning. Thom and Susan, and
Debbie as well as myself, along with Jeff Taylor and Tracy Goldman, were
the only people who witnessed Robert’s freak-out at Susan’s party: everyone
else had left, and none of us mentioned it to anybody in our class; it hadn’t
become a story, gossip one of us told by the lockers or the tables beneath the
Pavilion in a lowered voice the following week at Buckley. We stayed silent.
Robert couldn’t recall any of it—he only remembered the party until a certain
point and he didn’t know about the fight between Thom and Susan, or that he
gently guided Thom past the fire pit to the chaise by the pool afterward. The
party dimmed somewhere while he was greeting the people who wanted to
say hi and though he remembered at one point Debbie touching his shoulder
he couldn’t remember anything after that. All Robert knew, or so he said, was
that he woke up around ten o’clock Sunday morning on the couch Thom
Wright had placed him on in the living room with no idea where he was
before he stood, wrapped a sheet around himself and heard Debbie and Susan
still awake in the kitchen from the previous night. And they relayed what had
happened—the mania, the removal of clothing, the dive into the pool, sinking
to the bottom, splashing mindlessly at Thom—and Robert, Debbie told me,
seemed humiliated hearing this and started to silently cry, tears running down
his “surprisingly blank face” (Debbie’s description), which he urgently wiped
away. Susan told him not to worry: they wouldn’t tell anyone. Jeff and Tracy
and Thom were still sleeping upstairs and they were the only other ones
who’d seen the episode from the night before—for some reason she failed to
mention that I witnessed it, too. Susan assured Robert they wouldn’t say
anything either. Your secret is safe with us, I imagined her promising him.
—
WE LEFT BUCKLEY DURING LUNCH, taking the rest of the afternoon off
—we could do this infrequently as seniors if we were caught up on
homework and assignments—and Susan and Thom took the Corvette, and
Debbie had picked up the tangible participant from the house on Mulholland
that morning in her BMW and we followed the Corvette, as Robert followed
Debbie’s BMW in the Porsche, and since the early-afternoon traffic was light
we breezed through the Sepulveda Pass until we veered off the 405 and
merged onto the 10. The Jonathan Club was on the beach about a mile from
where the Santa Monica Freeway morphed into the Pacific Coast Highway.
Membership was invitation-only and by 1981 the club had been accused so
often of discrimination that the complaints weren’t even registering anymore
and had become something of an open joke: everyone supposed it was antiblack and anti-Jew (one reason Terry Schaffer wasn’t allowed) and no
women could be members, and though we were aware of the club’s purported
racism we just hadn’t attached a deep or real meaning to it, because 1981
wasn’t asking us to. To say that any of us were politically engaged was
stretching that notion into fairy-tale territory: we were teenagers distracted by
sex and pop music, movies and celebrity, lust and ephemera and our own
neutral innocence. The fact that Ronald Reagan was president meant almost
nothing to us—if anything, like the purported racism of the Jonathan Club, it
was kind of a joke, absurd, nothing to take too seriously, because it was so
abstract, but of course we could afford to look at everything through this
prism of numbness.
The beach club was built in 1927 and the original architecture hadn’t
been tampered with since—it had a grand old-fashioned feel to it, rococo
almost; everything seemed over-scaled to me as a child, since I’d been going
there in the mid-1970s, when my father first joined, and we’d spend
weekends in the summer; the young and handsome all-male staff set you up
with fold-out chairs and oversized towels and as many giant teal-colored
umbrellas as your party needed on the private beach. The parents lounged on
the sand with the latest bestsellers while their kids explored the Olympicsized indoor pool, the tennis courts, the Ping-Pong tables, the glimmering sea.
This was all pure empire: careless sunburns and endless sugary soft-serve icecream cones from the cafeteria—you just signed for everything—and reenacting scenes from Jaws with friends in the shallows of the Pacific, Elton
John and Rod Stewart playing from tape decks and transistor radios, the
towering bluffs of Santa Monica looming as a backdrop, the California
Incline winding above us. There were the prerequisite hot SoCal lifeguards I
studied intently and in the men’s locker room you could always casually
wander around—it was high-ceilinged and vast, unchanged from 1927—and
catch sight of older teenage boys changing in and out of bathing suits or
taking showers, where they would wash the sand and salt water from their
tanned, lithely muscled bodies.
—
THAT THURSDAY the parking lot at the beach club was almost completely
empty and the lone valet wearing a Jonathan Club cap and shirt walked over
and though the attendants usually wrote down the make and license-plate
number of the vehicle, today the valet didn’t, and just opened the doors as we
got out of our separate cars.
“Where is everyone?” Thom asked.
The attendant, a blond lifeguard with a Valley drawl, said, “Oh, we had
some problems with that cult.”
We gathered around him carrying our respective beach bags and stared
blankly—I seemed to be the only one who was aware of the cult.
“Riders of the Afterlife, y’know?” the valet said. “They broke in two
nights ago, vandalized something, took food from the cafeteria, and they keep
coming around, harassing people leaving the parking lot, and they come in
from the beach. It’s a private beach and we’ve got lifeguards but they can
only keep so many of those freaks out.”
The valet wasn’t handing us tickets for the cars because, I realized with a
chill, there weren’t any other cars in the parking lot.
“They’ve been all over Santa Monica and Venice this week,” the valet
said. “A lot of break-ins. Vandalism. Missing pets.”
Thom looked around the empty lot, his Wayfarers hanging from a
lanyard around his neck, and muttered, “Jesus.”
The valet said, “I understand if you want to head out. It’s been pretty
quiet today. We’re probably going to close up early, so…” His voice trailed
off.
We all looked at each other until Debbie made the decision by simply
saying, “We’re already here.”
I reminded her about the intruder at the space on Melrose a month ago
and what the cult was capable of and Debbie waved me off. “Some dumb
hippie scratched a little girl,” she said dismissively. “Please.”
This answer caused Susan to automatically turn toward the desk leading
into the club and sign in for the group using Donald’s account number, and
the valet didn’t ask for any ID to check if the last names matched with the
roster because it didn’t seem to matter that day.
And then the five of us headed to the steps that took us to the walkway
leading to the locker rooms as a cold gust of wind whipped the American flag
above the entrance. Everyone was silent, as if the deserted club acted as a
warning, an omen, a portent—we needed to be on guard and conversation
was the distraction that could get us hurt. Because of the silence I could tell
that something had changed in the vibe between Susan and Thom since we’d
left Buckley only thirty minutes ago. There was a new distance—you could
feel it in their body language and in the way they weren’t acknowledging
each other: something had definitely happened on the drive over to Santa
Monica, which Debbie seemed coolly oblivious of, but she probably knew
exactly what was going on. Robert was following her. I lagged behind and
watched as he glanced at the empty tennis courts, which were usually filled,
the reservation list almost always packed, but not that day. The wind caused
the canopy leading into the club’s main building to ripple and snap loudly,
startling us out of our respective reveries.
—
THOM AND I HEADED to the men’s locker room with Robert following us,
a large black duffel bag over his shoulder, where we’d change out of our
Buckley uniforms and into bathing suits. There was no one around except a
manager at the front desk, who handed us our keys, and the lockers were
located next to each other, imposing a kind of intimacy on the three of us that
was perhaps unwanted by the other two guys. Robert kept talking about how
impressive the club was and he thanked us for bringing him regardless of
whether anyone else was there, while Thom just kept muttering how cold it
would be on the beach and if he ever saw one of those fucking freaks from
the cult approaching us he’d kick their butt. We started changing in front of
each other—Thom and Robert seemed less hesitant and self-conscious than I
was—and I took sidelong glances at them as we casually talked to each other
while stripping off our uniforms. Thom turned around when he slipped off his
underwear and quickly stepped into his bathing suit, unaware that I wanted to
see his smooth pale ass more than I wanted to see his dick, and Robert took
his cue from Thom and also turned as he slipped off his underwear,
momentarily naked; the whiteness of his taut ass cheeks contrasted with tan
quads lightly blanketed with sparse brown hair made me hitch in a breath.
We were all wearing the Polo swimsuits in Easter-egg colors that had become
so popular that summer: Robert’s was purple, mine was bright green, and
Thom’s was hot yellow. We decided to keep T-shirts on because of how cold
it was, and maybe, Thom said hopefully, we could take them off once we hit
the sand. Yes, hopefully, I thought to myself. Hopefully.
—
WHEN WE STEPPED OUTSIDE to wait for the girls I looked out at the
empty vista and shivered: it seemed so warm in the Valley that morning and
during lunch, and I’d expected throngs to crowd the private beach and help
make this afternoon an occasion. “Jesus,” Thom muttered, looking at his
watch, annoyed that the girls took as long as they always did, and then Susan
and Debbie appeared minutes later, wearing bikinis with cardigan sweaters
that draped to their knees, and they didn’t take off their sunglasses when they
silently greeted us. “Finally,” Thom muttered and then strode over to two
staff members waiting at a cabana where towels and chairs and umbrellas
were stored. We each took one of the oversized beach towels they handed to
us and Thom trudged through the sand, the two staff members following him,
one of them holding a teal umbrella that Susan requested and the other
carrying five fold-out beach chairs. Thom finally decided on a spot midway
between the shore and the club—it was where he always preferred. As the
two staff members dug the umbrella into the sand and laid out the five
folding chairs I noticed that the beach was almost completely deserted in
either direction and there were only faraway figures in the sun-blasted
distance. A lifeguard booth, unmanned, sat off to our side. Another gust of
cold wind rose up off the Pacific.
—
WE SAT IN A ROW on the sand, facing the ocean, seemingly none of us
happy to be there: we had made a mistake. Thom and Susan were at one end,
Robert was in the middle, and Debbie and I sat at the other end. Someone had
brought a boom box and we were listening to KROQ as the sun beat down
(only Susan and Robert wanted the shade from the umbrella), and though it
wasn’t overcast—only a lone bank of massive cumulus clouds floated above
the flat sheet of sea where it met the horizon—we occasionally complained
that it was freezing. Susan and Thom weren’t talking or even acknowledging
each other, sharing the same bad mood: Susan never took off her sunglasses
and Thom barely spoke. While pacing the sand considering a dip in the
ocean, I asked Thom about his upcoming trip and he made a dismissive
gesture before taking his T-shirt off and oiling himself with suntan lotion, and
I felt slightly wounded as I sat back down. Robert was the only one of us who
couldn’t sit still and kept getting up: he wanted to check out the indoor pool,
maybe take a quick swim—and then he made a joke about how he didn’t
need anyone to watch him, he could be unsupervised today. No one laughed,
though I looked up at him and politely smiled.
Thom lay back in the sun immobile, his pectorals and small brown
nipples and abdominal muscles gleaming, while he held up a copy of Sports
Illustrated with Wayne Gretsky on the cover. Debbie was leafing through an
issue of Interview, an oversized pastel drawing of Diana Ross staring out at
me. I was holding a Joan Didion paperback rereading the first essay in The
White Album and Susan was just staring out at the sea behind her Ray-Bans.
KROQ played only downbeat songs that afternoon: David Bowie and “Ashes
to Ashes” and the Rolling Stones’ “Emotional Rescue” and a new Police
single called “Invisible Sun” and the Doors’ “Riders on the Storm.” At one
point Thom stood up and said, “It’s too fucking cold,” and asked if anyone
wanted anything from the café as he slipped the T-shirt back on—he was
hungry. Susan murmured no and Debbie decided to go with him. Susan and I
didn’t say anything to each other the entire time they were gone. Robert
hadn’t returned. The sad songs kept playing. Thom came back with a club
sandwich and fries, and Debbie handed Susan an iced tea even though she
hadn’t asked for one. I was thinking about Audrey Barbour, the missing girl
from Calabasas, and, glancing at Robert’s empty chair, I wondered what else
was in the black duffel bag he was carrying—I looked for it but didn’t see it
and guessed he had taken it with him when he went to the pool. The waves
crested gently across the shore and I stared back at the book I was reading
and came across the words Petals on a wet black bough and a reference to
“The Wichita Lineman” and someone being unable to drive across the
Carquinas Bridge as I kept drifting away.
—
WHEN I FINALLY LOOKED UP the light had changed. I saw someone
approaching us in the distance and I became frightened it was one of the cult
members from Riders of the Afterlife, but I recognized the purple bathing
suit. Robert Mallory was walking aimlessly along the shore and I saw a
figure approach him in the frame, compact yet broad-shouldered, someone
male, maybe a surfer, and I sat up, interested, and then realized it was Thom.
They met and stood on the sand looking out at the ocean, shirtless and lit
orange by the fading sun, teenage Greek gods standing on the shores of Santa
Monica talking to each other, even though it was too far away to hear what
they were saying. It took me a moment to realize that Susan was looking over
at them as well, and the only sounds seemed ambient but heightened: the
movements of the sea, the DJ on KROQ, the traffic on PCH, the gulls
squalling. Thom and Robert stood facing each other as the waves foamed
white against their ankles and Thom seemed to be listening intently to
something Robert was telling him and nodded, understanding him, assuring
him it was all cool, similar to what I’d witnessed in the parking lot at Buckley
when I watched Robert talking to Matt Kellner on the first day of school—it
was the same scene but a different location, and I felt vaguely sickened, as if
a premonition had washed over me. This was maybe the only moment that
afternoon when I noticed Susan Reynolds lower her sunglasses while she
stared at the two boys in the faraway distance. Thom and Robert
contemplated the skyline and then Thom reached down to feel the
temperature of the water. He said something to Robert and they laughed. I
looked over at Debbie but she wasn’t paying attention, lying back in the foldout chair tanning herself, eyes closed. Susan still had her sunglasses lowered
as she watched Thom and Robert continue talking and I could feel her fear
rising and expanding around us, but why would there be fear? “Whatever,”
Susan said curtly to no one, turning away from the two boys on the shore.
—
AT A CERTAIN POINT Thom and Robert ambled to where we were lying
and then Robert said he was heading back to Century City and we murmured
our goodbyes as he swung the duffel bag over his shoulder. Susan was
numbly subdued to the point of catatonia and barely registered him. I stood
up and pretended to stretch but really wanted to watch as Thom walked with
Robert to where the sand turned to pavement and they gave each other a
slight bro-hug and Robert disappeared into the entrance of the locker room
and Thom turned around and jogged back to where we were, the light falling
around us as the ocean slowly darkened. Thom flopped down on the fold-out
chair and picked up the copy of Sports Illustrated. And no one said anything
for ten minutes, until Susan finally suggested that maybe we should probably
get going—it was too cold, she was tired, Thom needed to pack for his trip.
“I’m already packed,” he snapped, not looking at her. Debbie reluctantly
agreed with Susan, which overrode everything—the girls always won. I
picked up my Gucci backpack and said I was going to take a quick shower
and Thom told me we’d meet by the entrance. It was over between Susan and
Thom, I thought to myself as I walked away from the friends who were
slipping into the past. Something had happened.
—
THE MANAGER WAS GONE. I noted his empty desk as I entered the
locker room.
The space was too vast to be completely silent even when empty, and the
slightest impression echoed everywhere, and when it was filled with males,
young and older, the noise could be deafening. I heard the late-afternoon
traffic on PCH but it was muted and the sound of water dripping from the
shower stalls was the central intonation—but who had taken a shower? I
wondered. There was no one here, right? I thought. “Robert?” I said
tentatively. No one answered. I walked past a row of lockers to the open
blue-tiled stall, which had fourteen separate showerheads sharing the same
space and because of its emptiness suggested no one was in the locker room.
I’d planned on taking a shower because it was so cold and not because I
wanted to wash water and sand off myself—it would simply warm my body
—but instead I headed to my locker, noticing that Robert’s was hanging
open, empty, as I shoved my Buckley uniform into the Gucci backpack, and
then heard a toilet flushing and was surprised that anyone else was in the
locker room—I assumed I’d been the only person. And then I waited for
follow-up sounds but all I could hear was just the echoing drip coming from
the shower stall. “Robert?” I asked again.
I walked slowly through the space, which was usually lit by fluorescent
bulbs, but because no one was there that day most of them were darkened and
just the light coming in from the panel of windows below the high ceilings
offered any illumination. The locker room was always filled with sons and
brothers and fathers, men of all ages, and I’d never been there when it was
empty, even remotely, and when a stall door swung open, and a toilet flushed
again, I jumped, startled. I could only hear the dripping echoes from where
the showers were located. I took a deep breath to calm myself and turned a
corner and walked to where twenty toilet stalls were lined against a wall, their
blue doors mostly closed. I hesitated before I moved toward the one stall
where the door was fully opened and swallowed whatever apprehension I felt
and decided not to be a pussy and see if anyone was still there. Some dumb
hippie scratched a little girl. Please. “Robert?” I suddenly asked again. There
wasn’t an answer.
I also moved closer because there was a glow emanating from the open
stall, I realized and when I turned to face the stall I saw a small candle
flickering on the lid of the closed toilet—it was white and lightly melting and
situated directly in the center of the seat. I was confused until things began to
clarify themselves.
—
ON THE WALL ABOVE the toilet was a drawing I couldn’t make out in the
faded light. I looked around to see if anyone was watching me as I moved
into the stall—everything was completely silent—and I saw what the drawing
actually was: a pentagram painted red and dripping with what seemed like
blood. And then I froze when I saw the dead seagull, crushed and smashed
into the corner, folded in on itself, mangled, its white feathers stained red and
purple with blood, its neck twisted, its yellow beak opened in mid-cry.
Someone from the cult had gotten into the Jonathan Club locker room while
we were there. And a flash of anger hit, mixed with the sudden and very real
fear I felt in that moment: the blood illustrating the pentagram came from the
seagull, and the candle was supposed to represent a meaning. The sandals I
was wearing pressed down on a hard object near the toilet, beneath its bowl. I
thought at first it was something dead, another animal, another sacrifice, but
when I lifted my foot and looked down I saw it was only a mask. And I
couldn’t help myself: I lowered my arm and reached to pick it up. It was
hairy, there was some kind of fur on it, and when I brought it up to the light
of the candle I stared at the face of what I guessed was a werewolf, a cheap
Halloween mask, something a child would wear, lightly spattered with blood
from the seagull.
It felt dirty in my hands—the snout, the fangs, the lupine eyes squinting
into a growl—as I fingered the tight string where you secured the mask
around your face. I kept staring at the mask, wondering what its purpose was,
its meaning, how it tied into what the cult believed. I knew that the werewolf
mask had been purposefully placed there—it was supposed to complete the
meaning of the tableau, complement the dripping pentagram and the dead
seagull—but I didn’t know what it was supposed to add. Just that it was a
warning of some kind. And then I flashed on: maybe Robert Mallory had
done this.
In that silent moment someone suddenly touched my shoulder. I
screamed and whirled around.
—
IT WAS THOM, so startled by my reaction that he began laughing. I brought
a hand to my chest, and sagged against the stall door clutching the werewolf
mask. “Goddamn it, Thom,” I said.
Thom looked at the mask, curious, and leaned into the stall, glancing
behind me, his eyes darting from the pentagram to the seagull. “Jesus, they
got in while we were on the beach?” he asked in disbelief.
I just nodded, trying to control my breathing. And then he noticed
something and looked at me as if I was to blame.
“It’s just a dumb cult,” he said.
“I know,” I muttered.
“Why are you shaking so badly?” he asked while I walked away from
him.
“Let’s get out of here,” I said.
In the empty parking lot we told the attendant about what we found in
the men’s locker room and he took the news with an unnerving nonchalance.
“Yeah, they’ve been doing shit like that,” he confirmed. “Animal sacrifice
and shit. I’ll see if security can come in.” And then he left to get Debbie’s car
first. While Thom rifled through his wallet to give the valet a tip, Susan
finally responded to the world. She removed her sunglasses and gazed at me
and then Thom, and asked, “Are you okay?” But it was with a numbness that
almost rendered the question futile, and for the first time I realized Thom had
finally perceived this numbness and wasn’t happy about it—in fact, on that
cold afternoon at the beach club, it seemed as if he was genuinely appalled.
He just stared at her hard, his green eyes devoid of their usual friendliness,
his jaw clenched with rigid concentration. But it became a pose—he broke it
down with fake relief and smiled, touching the side of her face, and said
soothingly, “Yeah, babe, of course we’re okay.”
Later that night Thom called me at the empty house on Mulholland and
asked if I’d drive him to LAX the following morning.
18
I WAS SO SURPRISED BY Thom Wright’s request to drive him to the
airport that I didn’t have a contemplative moment to hesitate or use school as
an excuse or to tell him I didn’t want to—I just automatically said yes, even
though I later wondered why Thom’s mother or Susan wasn’t driving him
instead. That night Thom called my number on Mulholland and we had a
brief conversation back and forth about what happened at the beach club
before he asked if I could drive him to the airport, and after I agreed he told
me to pick him up at ten—the flight was at noon—and he’d see me tomorrow
morning. That was it. Driving to LAX wasn’t a hassle in 1981 and I wasn’t
going to miss anything important in my morning classes at Buckley, and
besides I would have probably done anything Thom Wright asked me to. I
wanted to be around him, to be of use to him, to be his servant, and I gladly
accepted the offer to drive him to the airport. This might sound somewhat
absurd and adolescent but I felt special that Thom had requested this from me
as I drove over to Laurie Wright’s house on North Hillcrest Drive, between
Sunset Boulevard and Elevado Street in Beverly Hills to pick up Thom at
10:00 a.m. on that Friday morning to take her son to LAX for an American
Airlines flight that left at twelve. Lionel had purchased the ticket and was
flying Thom to New York first class, which Thom waved off as being
excessive, a little desperate, and totally reeking of guilt—Thom mentioned
he’d be fine in coach but Lionel insisted, and I knew that Thom would’ve
been excited either way, because first class didn’t really matter to Thom
Wright, or so I assumed in my fantasy of him, which ended up getting
slightly cracked that morning.
—
IT WAS A HOPELESS TRIP in many ways, because Thom knew he would
be going to UCLA, but it gave him time to spend with his father—Thom
being one of the only guys I’ve ever met who had a closeness with his dad
that approached the brotherly. When Lionel moved to New York during the
separation from Laurie, I knew this wounded Thom profoundly but everyone
understood why Lionel did it: an opportunity too financially rewarding to
ignore, and Lionel needed the money, considering how expensive the divorce
turned out to be. Thom weathered it stoically, refusing to let it affect him to
the degree where he was distracted from school or sports, and in crucial ways
the separation and subsequent divorce intensified Thom’s dedication, striving
toward a certain kind of excellence while gaining a new knowledge of the
world—he had learned something terrible about adults and marriage and
moved through it. Lionel relocating to New York also brought Thom closer
to Susan in many ways and it brought Thom and me closer to each other than
we’d previously been. I admired everything about Thom Wright and, despite
his obvious physical beauty, what I loved most was really his attitude and the
way he cared about things and how he always put a positive spin on any
potentially negative situation: you fall down, you get up; self-pity is for
losers; don’t be a pussy.
But this was easy to do when you were rich and handsome, and except
for Lionel’s abandonment Thom had never faced any hardship—he was, as
we all were in today’s parlance, a white privileged male, a king of the system,
but Thom didn’t flaunt it the way Jeff Taylor or Anthony Matthews did,
bragging about their freedom while strutting along the pool’s edge or peeling
their Camaro out of the Fred Segal’s parking lot, a what-the-fuck entitlement
I also admired, especially as a writer, just as I was drawn to the outsider on
the fringes like Matt Kellner or the insider with a secret like Ryan Vaughn,
but that all floated away and seemed lost and disingenuous beside Thom
Wright’s earnest amiability, something that he was able to connect with more
easily because of his physicality and wealth.
—
WHEN I PICKED HIM up he was dressed for cooler weather: corduroys and
a navy-blue Polo argyle vest and a tweed blazer. Laurie Wright was in a pink
robe, hugging her son in the front doorway of the white two-story colonial,
and then Thom walked the stone path dividing the lawn, wheeling a large
piece of gray Samsonite luggage with a carry-on bag slung over his shoulder,
Wayfarers on, his hair still slightly damp from a shower and freshly shaven.
Laurie waved to the car and I waved back, turning down the stereo. The
mystery that hung everywhere as I drove from Mulholland to the flats of
Beverly Hills was: Why isn’t Susan Reynolds taking Thom to the airport?
Why wasn’t that happening in the narrative? I wondered this again as I
popped the trunk and Thom heaved the Samsonite bag in. But soon Thom’s
presence erased any questions, because he was sitting next to me in the
450SL, in the flesh, and I could smell the shampoo and deodorant and
whatever soap he used and the light scent of Aramis, the cologne Thom
preferred—all of this mattered more. We weren’t in a rush: in 1981 Thom
could just check his bag and amble to the gate after I let him out at the curb in
a semi-deserted midday LAX minutes before the plane took off—there were
no checkpoints, you could go anywhere you wanted in an airport then, flights
were often half filled, everyone dressed up. I was used to Thom’s presence,
having known him since 1976 and whenever I was alone with him—either
driving around or sitting together in a movie theater or with our knees
pressing against each other at lunch or with him showing me something in his
notebook while just wearing his tight jockey shorts and standing close to me
in the locker room—I never failed to experience a distracting erotic thrill, but
it was faint and distant because there was no way to act upon it. What would
Thom have done if I’d lightly rested my hand on his thigh as we drove to
Westwood on a Saturday? How would Thom have reacted if I’d leaned over
and kissed him as we sat side by side in the Nuart?
Thom immediately fiddled with the radio and landed on KROQ—
Depeche Mode, “Just Can’t Get Enough”—as I pulled away from the curb
and started heading down Hillcrest.
“How you doing, buddy?” Thom asked.
“I’m good, man,” I said. “I’m doing okay.”
“Yeah?” he said. “I was worried about you a little bit there.”
“Really?” I asked, startled. “When?” And then realized what he was
referring to but didn’t confirm it for him. “Oh. Yeah?”
“Everything’s gone by so fast,” he said, easing the seat back to
accommodate his legs. He then rummaged through the leather carry-on: I
glimpsed a Walkman, and a thick paperback, The Stand.
“I know, we haven’t gone to the movies or hung out, in like forever,” I
said. “Just us.”
“I know, I know, it’s crazy,” he said. “But you’re okay?”
“Yeah.” I paused. “Why do you keep asking that?” I said, knowing what
the reason was. “I’m good.”
“I just thought about what happened to Matt and I know you two were
closer than I realized…” Thom said this without any sense of secrecy or
judgment. “I mean I don’t think I knew the guy at all but I feel bad that you
lost a friend.” Thom paused. “Why didn’t you ever tell me you guys were
close?”
“Tell you what?” I asked. “What was there to tell?” I paused. “We hung
out sometimes,” I said as I braked at the stop sign on Santa Monica. “I bought
weed from him.”
“I thought you didn’t smoke weed,” Thom said. “Or if you did I thought
you’d buy it from Jeff.”
“I guess you never knew.” I shrugged. “I bought from both.”
“What really happened?” Thom finally asked. “Do you know anything?”
“I guess he had some drug issues and um…” I suddenly couldn’t
concentrate, making the turn onto the boulevard, thinking about Matt. “It was
an accident,” I said, hoping this would wrap things up, waiting for the
passing traffic to flow by. “Just this freak thing.”
“Jeez,” Thom said softly. “That’s crazy.”
“Yeah,” I said. “I know.” And then: “It sucks.”
I started driving along Santa Monica, cruising through every light until
we came to Rodeo, where Thom said, “I’ve missed you, man,” turning
toward me. Only Thom Wright could say something like that without it
sounding scripted and cloying and I was touched and I turned back to him
and smiled. “Yeah, I know, we’ve got to hang out when you get back.” “For
sure,” Thom said. We started heading toward Wilshire Boulevard and were
just listening to music—New Order, the Cure—when I asked him if he was
looking forward to the trip, suddenly eager to find out Thom Wright’s state of
mind, where he was floating emotionally; everything about him was
interesting to me. He sighed, trying to formulate the best answer for my
question without lying. “I’m just doing it for my dad,” Thom admitted.
“Yeah?” I asked. “I guess I knew that.”
“I mean I’m going to UCLA, dude,” Thom said. “And he knows it. The
places we’re looking at? I mean I can get into all of them but I don’t want to
leave L.A. I mean I don’t know what my dad is thinking, it’s kind of sad—I
want to hang out with him but I’d rather just stay in New York for a week.”
Thom stared out the window as the Beverly Hills Park passed by. “But it’ll be
fine,” he said, reassuring me as if I needed it.
“I know it will,” I said. “Lionel is cool.”
“Yeah,” he said, sighing. “My dad’s cool.”
“Is your mom still seeing that guy?” I asked, just wanting to make
conversation so I could hear his voice.
“Who?” he asked, surprised. “David?”
“Yeah, I guess,” I said. “Whoever that was at Homecoming.”
“David,” Thom said, distractedly. “I don’t know how serious it is. He
seems nice. I want my mom to be happy. She’s been pretty miserable.” He
paused and then added, “The last ten years.”
I laughed and then he laughed as well. Thom wanted everyone to be
happy, everyone deserved the best, life was unfair and you had to snap out of
it and make it happen for yourself. He had been through something punishing
—his parents’ separation, his father’s abandonment, the drawn-out divorce—
and exited the other side, stronger and unscathed, so why hadn’t Laurie?
Thom turned to me. “You know what? She makes herself miserable. But she
always has. So—I want her to be happy but I don’t know if she’s capable of
it.” I had nothing to say: there was nothing to fix, it was too vast a problem
for me to offer advice, I’d known of Laurie Wright’s unhappiness for a long
time, Thom had his own coping mechanism to deal with it. We were now
heading along Wilshire, curving through the corridor of apartment buildings,
heading toward the 405, when Thom suddenly asked me something as he
lowered the volume on the radio, fading out a Human League song.
“Can you do me a favor?”
“Sure, man,” I answered automatically. “What is it?”
He crossed his legs, shifting in the passenger seat, trying to get
comfortable.
“Can you kind of keep an eye on Susan, um, while I’m gone?” he asked.
I went cold inside—it was as if someone had turned off a switch—but I
managed to ask casually, clearly, “Keep an eye on? What does that mean
exactly?” I may have thought I wanted to perform any task Thom Wright
requested but realized in that moment, as we cruised past Westwood and
toward the freeway, that this wasn’t true any longer. There was a suggestion
in that request of something distrustful and perverse. He wanted me to be a
secret agent and make sure his girlfriend was behaving—or at least that’s
what the request sounded like in the cabin of the Mercedes. There was
something childish and weak about the request—something a loser would
ask, not Thom. The day was getting wrecked, but softly, in a hushed way.
This was the moment when I started looking at Thom Wright from a different
angle. I was surprised and disappointed.
“Just hang out and make, I don’t know, a concentrated effort to hang out
with her a bit more.” Thom paused, unsure if he should admit what he wanted
to tell me so he could explain the meaning behind this request. “I don’t know
what she’s going through exactly…but if you’d just, y’know, keep an eye on
her. Go to the movies. Stuff like that.” I was silent and stared out the
windshield, contemplating what Thom just asked me, and how I should
answer. The tangible participant suddenly arrived and had one idea of what to
say, but the real Bret had another.
“You mean spy on her,” I said. “You want me to spy on your girlfriend.”
“No,” he said, and then laughed. “I don’t want you to spy on my
girlfriend.”
“What are you worried about?” I asked.
“I’m not worried about anything,” Thom said but he sounded
unconvinced.
“Really?” I asked. “You’re not worried about something?”
He sighed. “Bret, just do what you usually do—whatever, keep an eye on
her,” Thom said, slightly frustrated. “That’s all I’m asking.”
“Is that what I usually do?” Thom was dragging me into something that I
didn’t want to deal with—everything about it seemed tinged with betrayal
and bad faith and suspicion and all the things that I didn’t know and others
did: whispered secrets, the girlfriend who desired another guy, the girlfriend
who had become numb and wanted to break away, the real reasons a
classmate was prescribed Thorazine and spent six months in a mental
institution outside of Jacksonville. Thom was silent, thinking things through,
before he asked, “Do you…” He changed his mind. “Oh, forget it. It’s
nothing.”
“What?” I said—I was completely cold by then, steeling myself,
gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles were white. “Ask me.”
“What do you think of Robert now?” Thom asked. “I mean…after he’s
been here a couple months? Have your…feelings changed about him? Do
you…like him now?” Thom was asking this in an uncharacteristically halting
manner I’d never heard before. This suddenly seemed like a test I had to pass,
and I started answering as the tangible participant but kept getting sidetracked
by the real Bret, who argued: Why would you have to hide your feelings
about Robert Mallory? Just be upfront with Thom Wright—you’ve known
him for almost six years—and tell him what you really think. Don’t be such a
pussy. But this didn’t happen: because what could I tell him? That I thought
Robert Mallory was somehow connected to Matt Kellner’s death? That I
thought that he was responsible for the hallucinogens and the blood on the
backpack and the drive out to Crystal Cove and that Matt probably stayed at a
house on Benedict Canyon that week, wasted on drugs, while Robert attended
Buckley, acting out a role, pretending nothing was happening, as a boy
slowly went mad in a locked room on the second story of that house,
surrounded by candles lit in a ritual?
“Oh…um, yeah,” I stammered, the tangible participant was disappearing
from me, waving goodbye as the rain swept across the vista he was standing
on and I needed to bring him back in order to continue the conversation.
“Yeah, I guess.” And then I paused. “I don’t really know him, Thom.” I
stopped again. “Obviously, he has…issues. He’s on medication, he spent
time in, um, that place in Jacksonville. I hope he gets better…but whatever
happened at Susan’s party was fucking crazy, though.” I had to stop before I
went on a tangent and offered a litany of things I thought were wrong about
Robert Mallory. “Why are you asking me this?” I tried to camouflage my
worry and annoyance with a soft, almost pleading voice. Thom was silent for
a long time as I sped up the on-ramp of the 405 and merged into the light
mid-morning traffic zooming along the freeway toward LAX.
“I don’t know,” he finally said. “Do you think he’s a nice guy?”
“A nice guy?” I asked. “What does that even mean?”
“Bret,” Thom warned, and then he asked again, “do you think he’s a nice
guy?”
“Are you going to tell him my answer?” I couldn’t help but ask back.
Thom looked at me, and then, sounding shocked, asked, “What?” He
realized something. “No, no, of course not. I’m not going to tell him
anything. You can be honest with me, dude.” He stopped, concerned, and
worriedly asked, “I hope you always are.”
“Nice guy?” I asked. “Maybe.” I dreaded having this conversation. It
was the last thing I thought Thom would want to talk about and it had already
ruined my mood. “Do you?” I asked, both daring him and being evasive. “Do
you think Robert’s a nice guy?”
I noticed he had turned to me again, gauging my features as I was about
to form another answer explaining who I thought Robert Mallory really was
while concentrating on the lane I was speeding across. “I can’t tell,” Thom
said, as if something had finally stumped him—a plotline Thom couldn’t
figure out. “It’s weird.”
I breathed in, pretending to play dumb. “What does that mean?” I asked.
“You can’t tell? You can’t tell what?”
“It means sometimes I think I’m dealing with one person…” Thom
started. “And then I feel I’m dealing with…an actor.” He shook his head.
“I’m not explaining this right, but someone pretending to be something…”
“No,” I said as relief started flooding through the coldness and dread. “I
feel that way about Robert sometimes, too.”
“Yeah?” he said in a hopeful voice, and then, after thinking things
through, admitted in a rush: “I mean, I know you probably don’t like him. I
know your feelings probably haven’t changed. I don’t know why I’m even
asking you. I’m sorry.”
“What was he talking to you about on the beach?” I asked. “Yesterday?”
Thom was now looking through the windshield—we were sharing the
same view.
“Well,” Thom started, “he was telling me about how grateful he was that
he had friends here.” Thom stopped then started again, unsure. “And then…
he started telling me about how…he thinks he’s being followed and—”
“He’s being followed?” I asked—I automatically thought of myself but I
knew that wasn’t what Robert was referring to when he told Thom this
yesterday on the beach.
“Yeah, he said it’d been going on for a while and that—these are his
words—‘some freak’ is out there and has been following him ever since he
first started coming to L.A. a year or so ago. Stalking him. Sometimes.”
Thom paused. “That’s what he was telling me on the beach yesterday and
that’s when I realized that he’s still, I don’t know, maybe a little mental?”
This came out as a question that Thom wanted me to answer in a reassuring
voice that I just couldn’t muster: No, he’s not, Thom. Hey, come on, buddy,
he’s our friend, he’s not mental, he’s cured.
“Some…freak?” I asked instead. “What does that mean? Did he say who
it was?”
“Yeah, like someone stalking him, that’s the word he used, stalking, and
he doesn’t know who it is,” Thom said. “I didn’t know what to say. Y’know,
being in the…” Thom looked over at me and tried to lighten the darkness that
had descended on the conversation. “…the loony bin.”
“You mean the developmental center,” I said sternly, trying to amuse
him. But none of this was funny and neither of us laughed.
“Yeah,” Thom said tentatively. “So…I don’t know how much to believe,
because, I mean, he…could be making it up, right?” Thom asked in a tone
approaching bewilderment. “But he says there’s this person out there who has
been, like, watching him and sending him stuff. I didn’t know what to say.
Maybe there is. Or maybe he’s…imagining it, I don’t know.” Thom stopped.
“Anyway, that’s what we were talking about on the beach.”
In the pause that followed I realized we were almost at the off-ramp for
the Howard Hughes Parkway and I started moving across lanes to reach it.
“But I know Susan cares about him,” Thom said. “And I know that she
thinks he’s a kind of cause, someone to help out…” He trailed off as I looked
over my right shoulder.
“Thom, what’s happening between you and Susan?” I asked, once I
veered down the curve of the off-ramp. “You can tell me. I won’t say
anything to her.”
“I don’t know,” Thom muttered. “I think she’s questioning a lot of stuff
and we’re all gonna be graduating and I think she’s just preparing herself…”
“Preparing herself,” I repeated. “For what?” And then I inhaled. “Thom,”
I said, “she’s been a bitch. Come on. Get real, dude. She’s turned into a total
bitch.”
When I said this Thom flipped open the passenger-seat visor to study
himself in the mirror, checking for something on his face. He didn’t find it.
He pushed his fingers through his hair. He closed the visor: a useless gesture
to deflect what I’d just said.
“Why don’t you tell me what you really think,” he said flatly.
“I just want you to be happy, man,” I said. “I’ve never seen you guys
fight. And now I’ve seen it twice in the last week and you guys were totally
silent on the beach yesterday and—”
“We’re good, dude, we’re good,” Thom insisted.
“Why isn’t she taking you to the airport?” I asked.
“Because I wanted to talk to you,” Thom said.
“Because you want me to spy on your girlfriend?”
“No, no—”
“Because you think she’s going to do something with Robert Mallory?”
“Do something?” Thom asked, dubiously.
“Yeah, do something,” I said.
“What?” Thom said, honestly shocked. “Why in the fuck would you
think that?”
“Because I think he’s capable of something,” I said.
“But…” Thom stopped and thought about what he was going to say.
“But what?”
“But don’t you think he’s gay?” Thom asked.
“Who?” I asked back, completely confused.
“Robert,” Thom said, looking at me strangely when I turned my head to
face him. “Don’t you think he’s probably gay?” Thom stopped. “Don’t you
think that’s his real problem?” Thom was looking at me but I had turned back
and was staring out the windshield as I glided onto Howard Hughes Parkway
and then to Sepulveda. “That’s what he’s hiding from us,” Thom said.
“Right?” He paused. “That’s why he was in the institution.”
My mind was riveted with confusion. I was so frustrated with Thom in
that moment that I almost started writhing in my seat, but I kept cool.
“What in the hell are you talking about?” I asked quietly. “Why would
you think this?”
“Well, I…suspected it,” Thom said. “I think it was confirmed the night
of Susan’s party. Trying to make out with me, dude—”
“Thom, I think that was just the combo of booze and the Thorazine and
whatever else he’s taking,” I said. “He was also trying to kiss Susan—”
“So then he’s bi—”
“I don’t think Robert Mallory is gay,” I said carefully. “Has he hit on
you?”
“No,” Thom said. “But I get the gay vibe from him. You don’t?” And
then he asked, “Did he ever make a move on you?”
“What’s the…gay vibe?” I asked. “No, he hasn’t.”
This was the first moment that I can look back on in my life when I can
locate the cluelessness of heterosexuals about gay men. If Thom Wright
assumed, based on nothing, that Robert was gay, then what did he intuit
about me? About Ryan Vaughn, his co-captain of the Buckley Griffins?
About Jeff Taylor, who occasionally accepted cash for sexual favors from
Ron Levin? This absurdity took every muscle I had to refrain from saying,
Dude, he wants to bang your girlfriend what the fuck are you talking about
how could you get this so wrong? But instead, I just murmured, “I don’t think
Robert’s gay, dude.” We were now on Sepulveda and I veered right onto
Skyway. The Theme Building—its crossed arches, the iconic space-age
structure, a flying saucer with four legs—was in view. The traffic was sparse
in Departures, and there were just a few cars in front of the American
Airlines terminal as I parked the 450 at the curb and Thom and I got out. I
opened the trunk and helped him lift the tightly packed Samsonite.
“I’ll be back in a week,” Thom said. “Thanks for the ride.”
“You okay?” I asked.
“I’m great, buddy,” he said, smiling, seemingly completely unfazed by
the conversation we’d just had. “You’ll keep an eye on her?” he asked once
more. I nodded and then watched as he disappeared past the sliding glass
doors and into the terminal. This was the last time I ever saw Thom Wright
happy.
—
I WAS SHAKING when I got back into the Mercedes and started driving
toward the city. Everything crashed around me after the conversation with
Thom Wright on that morning in October: my notions of him became
rearranged, altered—I no longer looked at Thom in the same way after he
asked me to keep an eye on Susan Reynolds, or that he assumed his biggest
romantic threat was actually gay. And yet he asked me about Susan because
he must have suspected something about her and the uncertain possibilities
floating in the air or maybe, the other voice argued, Thom simply cared and
was worried about leaving his girlfriend unattended for a week because she
might miss him too much and act out. And none of this had anything to do
with Robert Mallory because, according to Thom, maybe Robert was gay,
without realizing you had to be gay to understand that Robert Mallory most
definitely wasn’t gay, and Thom had started paying attention to another
narrative that he thought was unfolding—Thom isn’t dumb exactly—and this
would be, in the end, his downfall, another painful life lesson, this one about
girls and relationships and love, the first heartbreak, a year of sadness that
Thom would have to push through while both he and Susan attended UCLA,
trying to avoid each other on the tree-lined paths and the green quads and the
streets of Westwood.
But maybe this all added up to nothing, I thought, trying to console
myself. Maybe the writer was creating yet another scenario doomed with
disillusionment and pain—and because of this the tangible participant
suddenly reappeared and interrupted: of course I’d keep an eye out on
Thom’s girlfriend and plan a few events for the weekend. Maybe we’d go to
the Windover Stables and watch Debbie ride Spirit; a number of horror
movies had opened I wanted to see—Galaxy of Terror, Strange Behavior,
The Pit—or maybe we’d go to the Seven Seas on Saturday night and dance to
Siouxsie & the Banshees and Soft Cell and Adam & the Ants and drink
whiskey sours and do bumps of Debbie’s cocaine, lose ourselves in the last
year of youth. I steadied myself as I drove to Buckley because I now had a
plan. Who was I kidding? There was no way I wouldn’t help Thom Wright
and if this meant spying on Susan Reynolds then it was a job I’d embrace, not
only without complaint but eagerly, so I could please the king.
—
I ARRIVED AT BUCKLEY about thirty minutes before lunch began and sat
downstairs in the library, thinking I was going to dutifully study for the SATs
I planned on retaking at the end of the month, but I was just fooling myself
and bored and I walked upstairs to check out the Los Angeles Times, which I
hadn’t read that morning because I woke up late and headed over to Beverly
Hills to pick up Thom—I knew I wasn’t going to school on time and didn’t
set the alarm. There were usually two or three copies of the Los Angeles
Times in the magazine rack by the front desk that the school librarian, Miss
Crumbrine, presided over. I nodded to her as I took a copy from the
newspaper holder and she simply greeted me with “Bret” in her carefully
controlled and modulated voice—it always sounded like a put-down—and
then I carried the L.A. Times over to a dark-wood-paneled cubicle and sat,
unfolding the paper. Something started screaming at me from the front page:
a row of black-and-white photos of Katherine Latchford, Sarah Johnson, Julie
Selwyn and Audrey Barbour accompanied an article about the serial killer
haunting the San Fernando Valley, who had sent a detailed letter to the Los
Angeles Times last week that was verified by both the paper and the LAPD as
coming from the Trawler. Everything disappeared around me.
—
MY EYES SHOT UP to the first paragraph of the article and I barely
breathed when I turned to the “Metro” section, where it continued, blasted
across an entire page with photos of where the girls’ bodies were found as
well as excerpts from the letter itself—some of it typed and redacted, some of
it scrawled in different-color pens—which detailed a day only last week
where “I and my friends” spent the afternoon wandering through an
abandoned mill looking for the “appropriate dumping ground” and then
stealing another dog last night from a neighborhood where an upcoming
target was located—“the sacrifice” is how the Trawler referred to the target,
who would ultimately be left to “the God.” The article was a jagged piece of
insanity and I had no idea why the Los Angeles Times was quoting so
liberally from this madman’s letter—it was repellent, ghastly, and yet I
inhaled it like I was starving because it confirmed something for me and I
located the hideous truth being expressed: the secret madness of the world
was revealed. And it was, admittedly, fascinating to read details that clarified
this monster’s life and try to uncover what the motive might have been. The
article quoted how he and “his friends” lived in motels and moved across the
city by night, “following the moon,” hitting on certain neighborhoods,
looking for houses with the easiest access or perhaps finding out where
potential victims they’d already “targeted” resided, and then “tracking” them
to judge which ones were suitable for “sacrifice” and which ones were not,
the ones they would be able to leave for “the God.” The letter detailed how
the Trawler and “his friends” watched young women jog alone on empty
streets through a pair of binoculars, or maybe they shuffled after them
through a mall’s food court or were waiting for them in a public parking lot
by the beach, hoping to find a target who was “appropriate” for “the God.”
The bodies were referred to as “paradises” that were needed in order to show
off “the alterations,” and the Trawler confirmed that he had been “altering”
for years before he arrived in Los Angeles and that this city was just a next
step in “the continuum.”
—
THE PAPER WOULDN’T CLARIFY what the “alterations” were and they
avoided listing the materials the Trawler used, only confirming that the
alterations would begin before he had “removed the life from the body,” and
that “its blood” was tied to what he referred to as “The arousal” and once the
arousal was maintained then the removal of “tissue and muscle and flesh”
would happen so the alterations could begin. These were also referred to in
the letter as “the remakings” and “the assemblage.” There were a few details
—the bleach poured into buckets, the hacksaw that went dull, the collection
of Polaroids—that were rendered with even more horror because of what was
left out. The mind automatically went to: What were the buckets of bleach
for? Why was the hacksaw dull? What were the Polaroids of? And, confused,
the mind answered these questions in the most gruesome ways. There were
the “lonely spaces” between the murders, where the “blood lust washed”
toward him, and that’s when the home invasions would begin again and what
the Trawler called “the rearrangements,” which were actually “tests” to see
“how viable” the “target was”—if they were suitable for “sacrifice” and “the
God.” There was the admission that he’d never “sacrificed” a target he had
physically attacked—those were two separate things—and that so much of
his time was spent “waiting” and that following people was what kept him
“in control” and “the rituals” were part of a repeating narrative that was
highly structured: the driving around, the selection of a particular
neighborhood, the selection of the house based on the selection of the
teenager who resided there, usually a girl, the stalking of the residence, the
search for animals. This narrative, the Trawler admitted, aided in quelling his
paranoia—he was distracted from “the pain” with “the project.” The
screaming of the victims, which the Trawler says he recorded, was the climax
of the “ultimate annihilation”: the larynx was crushed to stop the screaming
and “the orbital sockets” were gouged so no one could see “me and my
friends anymore” and the entire ritual could take up to a week by the time the
final “assemblage” had been completed. There was nothing confirmed about
Audrey Barbour in the article and there was no mention of Matt Kellner or
any male victims.
—
MY MIND WAS shrieking with horror when I finished the article, which had
the force and intimacy of an interview even though it was mostly made up of
excerpts from a madman’s letter, and I was suddenly exhausted—the article
was so unnerving that I pushed away from the cubicle feeling sick and knew I
could no longer stay at school and concentrate on the rest of the day—I
wouldn’t even be able to sit at lunch and follow a simple conversation
without a wave of fear cresting over me—and so I walked to the parking lot
and got back into my car and drove to the empty house on Mulholland, where
I walked past Rosa, who didn’t seem surprised to see me, and went to my
room and smoked what was left of Jeff Taylor’s weed and lay in bed
watching TV the rest of the afternoon, until it started getting dark, floating in
and out of reality, wondering what Thom was doing on the flight heading
east, and I suddenly envied his escape from Buckley and Los Angeles and the
Trawler and Robert Mallory and the girlfriend who was going to leave him. I
hauled myself off the bed and slowly removed the school uniform in a daze
and slipped on a bathing suit and walked outside to the pool, where I waded
in and slowly swam its length until I was tired enough to just sit in the
unheated Jacuzzi and stare at the darkening sky. I got out, dried myself off
and padded into the kitchen, where Shingy scrambled to attention and raced
over and leapt up on his hind legs as I searched through the refrigerator
looking for something to eat. Rosa was about to leave for the weekend and
we had a brief conversation about el perro; she reminded me to feed Shingy
the prepared food and not the dry dog food in the pantry, which I guess I had
mistakenly done last weekend, and I nodded at her, blank-faced.
I took a shower and sorted out my homework and decided to call Susan
at seven, which arrived surprisingly quickly.
—
I SAT ON THE EDGE of the bed and dialed Susan’s number but she didn’t
pick up—I got her answering machine instead. I was annoyed and left a
message, but the need to talk to her was overwhelming and I called the other
number at the house on Canon and waited while the phone rang until Gayle
picked up.
“Hey, Mrs. Reynolds, it’s Bret—is Susan there?”
“Oh, hi, Bret,” Gayle said. “How are you?”
She sounded slightly tipsy, overenthusiastic about my presence on the
other end of the line. I imagined her standing in the middle of the cold icewhite living room holding a glass of Chardonnay she was pouring from an
almost empty bottle.
“I’m fine,” I said. “I called Susan’s number and she didn’t pick up. I
thought maybe she was downstairs.”
“Oh,” Gayle said, sounding disappointed for me. “She went out to Palm
Springs after school—didn’t you know? She’s staying with her
grandparents.”
I stood up and started pacing. “She did?”
“Yeah, she came back from Buckley and left around four—I told her to
wait so she wouldn’t hit any traffic but she insisted.”
“Palm Springs, really?” I asked.
“Yeah, to see her grandparents,” Gayle reiterated. “She didn’t say
anything? She’d been planning this for weeks. And with Thom gone and
all…” She trailed off.
“Did she go with anybody?” I managed to ask.
“No, I don’t think so,” Gayle said. “Why?”
“I guess she told me,” I said, confused, and then: “Did Thom know she
was going to Palm Springs?”
“I assume so,” Gayle said coolly as if somewhat offended by my
question. “Is…anything wrong?”
“Oh, no, I’m fine, I’m fine,” I said, regaining my composure. “I guess
I’ll see her on Monday.”
“Yeah, she’s coming back Sunday night,” Gayle said. “You sure you’re
okay? You sound a little confused.”
“No, I’m fine; thanks, Mrs. Reynolds,” I said. “Have a nice night.”
“You too, Bret.” And then she clicked off.
—
I IMMEDIATELY walked out of my room, down the hallway, through the
kitchen and the living room to my mother’s bedroom and headed straight to
her nightstand, where I opened a drawer and found the red cover of the
Buckley roster. I hesitated only a moment and then walked to the wet bar to
get a drink so I could steady myself and realized the tequila was gone, as
were the rum and the two bottles of Smirnoff, and remembered with a pang
that everything had been drunk since my parents left. I found myself steeling
up as I walked back to my room and sat on the bed, opened the roster to
twelfth grade, located Robert Mallory’s number and waited, thinking through
what I was going to say when I asked for him. I tried to come up with a
reason but one wouldn’t materialize. Fuck it, I thought, and just dialed the
number listed in Century City.
Adrenaline lightly hummed through me as I waited for someone to pick
up while I paced the room. And then a woman’s voice answered the phone,
saying, “Hello?”
“Hi, I’m calling for Robert,” I said. “I’m a friend of his from Buckley.
I’m Bret. Bret Ellis.”
There was a brief pause suggesting a slight moment of confusion. “Oh,
hello, Bret,” the woman said as if she was composing herself. “Robert has
mentioned you. You went to the beach with him yesterday.” There was an
unmistakable uncertainty to her voice, as if the woman was quickly trying to
process both who I was and the reason why I was calling and somewhat
bewildered by both.
“Yes, yes, that’s me,” I said.
“I’m Abby, his aunt,” the woman said with a caution that was easy to
locate.
“Nice to meet you, Abby,” I said, rolling my eyes, impatient. “Is Robert
there? Can I talk to him?”
“Actually, he’s not here,” Abby said tentatively. “He’s…away for the
weekend.”
I closed my eyes and reached behind me to find the bed so I could sit
down.
“Hello?” she said when I didn’t respond.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t know.” And then I asked, “Where did
he go?”
It took her a moment before she said, vaguely, “Out to the desert.”
“I guess he didn’t tell me,” I said in a calm and casual voice. “I thought
maybe we could go to a movie tomorrow, but, um, okay…” I didn’t know
what else to say until, “Did he go with anybody?”
She paused, deciding something. “Not that I know of.” She answered in a
coolly diplomatic fashion.
“Do you, um, know where he’s staying?”
Another pause. “He told me he’s staying with a friend in Rancho
Mirage.” I heard her say this, again, in a vague and offhand way. But the
answer also had a finality to it that suggested: Don’t ask me anything else.
“Okay, well…” I trailed off.
“Should I tell him you called?” she asked.
“No, there’s no need,” I said, finding my voice. “I’ll see him on Monday.
Thank you, Abby.” I waited for her to say something else. She was silent too
long.
“Not a problem, Bret,” Abby finally said, and then she seemed to hesitate
until I hung up first.
—
I FOUND THE NUMBER of my aunt in San Francisco and called to ask if I
could stay at the house in Palm Springs that weekend and, surprised, she said
yes and told me where the key was hidden but warned that it had been closed
in early May and a housekeeper hadn’t been to air it out since the last week
of September—my aunt wouldn’t be opening it up for “the season” (as she
called it) until the end of October. I said it didn’t matter and thanked her and
then quickly packed a few things—I’d leave tomorrow, it was too late, I was
tired and didn’t want to drive at night, I’d leave Shingy enough food and
water, I’d only be gone a day. I kept asking myself as I lay in bed before the
Valium hit: how many people were involved in a lie and how long could they
keep it going before everything cracked open and the truth spilled out?
19
THE 111 MERGED INTO North Palm Canyon Drive and, passing the huge
wing-shaped roof of the visitors’ center on the edge of town, I realized I
hadn’t been out to the desert since Spring Break, in the first week of April,
when I went with Susan and Thom—Debbie wasn’t quite in my narrative yet,
at least we weren’t dating—and the three of us stayed at my aunt’s house on
Toledo Avenue.
The towering San Jacinto Mountains loomed over the city in the
darkening late afternoon, blocking out the sky, shadowing the boulders and
sand dunes, palm trees and cactus that lay spread out beneath it. I opened the
window of the Jaguar and the air smelled of brush and sage and it was warm
but mild compared to the astonishing heat of the summer months. And I
thought about how different things were now—bleak and death-haunted—
contrasted to those few days the three of us spent as juniors during Spring
Break, how innocent it seemed by comparison to where we’d arrived only a
few months later: a dumb, rowdy party at the Hilton; another at someone’s
house on Rose Avenue in a mid-century modern that once belonged to the
Kennedys, margaritas with fake IDs in the cantina at Las Casuelas, lying by
the pool listening to the Doors and Sinatra, going to see The Omen III,
horseback riding along the trails behind the Smoke Tree Stables, glimpsing
Thom removing his bathing suit in the outdoor shower below the ficus tree
and so bronzed that it looked as if his perfect ass and muscled thighs were
painted white, hanging with Susan in the mornings beneath the umbrella by
the Moroccan-tiled fountain, splitting a Quaalude while Thom slept in the
master bedroom until he would walk groggily out in just his jockey shorts,
the teenage Greek god yawning and rubbing his eyes, leaning in to give
Susan a kiss, which she accepted with a smile, before he sank into the
Jacuzzi, still lost in the dream that their relationship would move forward
through UCLA and beyond. That week Susan mainly wore a chic white
bikini—even picking up groceries and tequila at the Ralph’s we frequented
on Palm Canyon Drive—and I eyed the stares she got from so many men,
young and old, blatant and charged with lust, and wondered why she was
dressed so provocatively, revealing so much of her admittedly luscious body
to the world. But it didn’t matter, at least not then. I always brought my own
tensions to wherever I went but they dissipated that week in Palm Springs,
where the three of us lived together peacefully in the house on Toledo and
our futures seemed to be moving along the paths that were promised to us, as
we were arriving at the beginning of that paradisaical summer of 1981.
—
I HAD MADE IT in under a hundred minutes on Saturday afternoon,
uselessly speeding across the freeways, not knowing what I was going to
find, blankly staring out the windshield until I crossed the city limits—the
“Welcome to Palm Springs” sign took me out of my trance—and then I was
pulling into the curved driveway of the empty house on Toledo Avenue as
dusk settled over the desert.
I found a key beneath one of the terra-cotta pots that sat on the raked
gravel on either side of the entranceway and opened the doors that led into
the foyer. In the musty darkness I reached toward the wall for a switch and
the Sputnik chandelier lit up. I walked deeper into the house, turning on
another set of lights, revealing a massive high-ceilinged sunken living room
decorated in white and mustard with faint traces of purple, where a wall of
floor-to-ceiling windows were interrupted by a white marble fireplace
flanked by two of the many floor lamps with flower-patterned shades traced
violet and yellow that stood on a wide expanse of white shag carpeting. I
walked across the terrazzo floors in the kitchen and opened the refrigerator,
which was empty but still working. I looked through the sliding glass doors
that led out to the pool, and the backyard seemed barren, since the yellow
umbrellas and lounge chairs were now stored in the garage, and though the
pool was filled it was just a flat black surface lit only by the lights on the
patio.
I moved through a hallway until I arrived at the master bedroom and
opened the sliding glass doors to air it out. I sat on the bed and reached over
and turned on the nightstand lamp and waited, deciding what to do, the
numbness rendering me both calm yet clueless, as if I couldn’t figure out
exactly what it was I’d traveled to Palm Springs to find. But then I thought
about Matt Kellner, and then Audrey Barbour, and that none of us really
knew how dangerous Robert Mallory was—I seemed to be the only one who
suspected this—and the danger motivated me to get off the bed and drive to
Susan’s grandparents’ house, the main incentive being that it was only two
minutes from my aunt’s on Toledo; if it had been anywhere else I might not
have gone.
—
IT WAS NOW NIGHT and there was no one out on Toledo Avenue: just a
long stretch of wide and open highway that was only ever lightly traveled and
completely deserted on that Saturday. I drove for a few blocks and then made
a left onto Sierra and then a block later made another left onto a cul-de-sac
called Silverado, where I saw a white Cadillac and Susan’s BMW parked in
the driveway of a mid-century modern, ground lamps situated on the shiny
green lawn lighting an array of palm trees, and I felt a palpable relief that
broke through the numbness and faint dread because it meant Susan actually
was at her grandparents’ and not staying somewhere else. I slowly pulled my
car into the cul-de-sac, and as I made the turn that would take me back onto
Sierra I stopped. And though I knew this was always a possibility I was now
shot through with the fear that had been trailing me since the beginning of
September, because a black Porsche was parked next to the curb leading up
to Susan Reynolds’s grandparents’ house.
—
I TURNED off the headlights and parked on the other side of the street, away
from the house, and waited even though I didn’t know what I was waiting
for. I just sat there in the driver’s seat staring through the windshield as an
hour passed and then another one began. Nothing moved within the cul-desac—I couldn’t tell if the other houses were occupied, there didn’t seem to be
any cars in the driveways, there were no shadows or muffled voices behind
the bay windows of the living rooms or on the patios of the backyards. The
only light came from Susan’s grandparents’ and an ambient silence
surrounded everything, broken by the words I was muttering to myself within
the cabin of the Jaguar. There was something so brazen about what Susan and
Robert were doing—were they really so childish (or ill) as to think they could
get away with this? And then I thought: Was Robert actually staying with
Susan? Or was he really staying with a friend in Rancho Mirage, as his aunt
had suggested to me, and was only visiting Susan that night?
And then they stepped out of the house as I watched from the darkness of
the Jaguar.
They arrived at the car and Robert opened the passenger door for Susan.
As he walked around the Porsche to the driver’s side he stopped before
getting in and quickly scanned the neighborhood, as if he was purposefully
looking for someone, but didn’t seem to notice my mother’s car parked in
relative darkness—or it didn’t interest him. The Porsche revved up and
slowly pulled away from the curb and made a right onto Sierra. I waited a
beat and then started the Jaguar and followed them.
—
ROBERT DROVE INTO TOWN, where he pulled the Porsche into an open
parking lot situated in the middle of North Palm Canyon Drive at La Plaza
and found a space. I drove by and circled the block and then parked the
Jaguar at the opposite end of the lot, next to a hedge of pink bougainvillea,
and carefully made my way toward the street. There was only one place
where Susan and Robert would be going and that was Las Casuelas Terraza,
the town’s most popular Mexican restaurant, just a block up from where
Robert had parked. I breathed in, dizzy, as I moved along the sidewalk,
drifting past various people, just shapes, featureless to me, until I was where
the restaurant announced itself—I didn’t want to walk by the open patio that
faced the street, so I crossed to the opposite side of Palm Canyon Drive and
moved along the sidewalk there while keeping an eye on the restaurant,
which had been a fixture for me since my childhood.
It was almost overly familiar: the arched doorways, the adobe roof, the
mission bell in the stucco tower, the green shutters that framed the secondstory windows and the baskets of flowers hanging below them, the lanterns
that glowed on the patio, the palm trees looming in the darkness above. When
I looked up at the waving fronds and the twirling weathervane atop the
mission bell, I noticed the warm wind lightly gusting around me, the first
wave of that season’s Santa Anas, and I stared up at the San Jacinto
Mountains, which were now just a black mass overlooking the town, and
shivered. I could hear the mariachi band inside the cantina softly playing
“Hotel California” as I jogged across Palm Canyon and moved to the
entrance of Las Casuelas and walked up the steps through the open wooden
doors, and across the tiled entranceway, where I passed an empty hostess
stand beneath an iron chandelier and took a seat at the deserted bar that led
out to the cantina, which was where I assumed Robert and Susan were sitting.
A bartender startled me and asked what I’d like. I said “Just a water” before
changing my mind and ordered a Pacifico and then asked if I could have a
basket of complimentary chips and salsa. I needed to eat something or else I
was going to be sick. Once I downed the beer and ate a handful of the tortilla
chips I moved toward the arched entrance of the cantina, where the mariachi
band was playing, and which seemed crowded compared to the rest of Las
Casuelas that night—a slow Saturday in the off season. I motioned to the
bartender that I was going to move to the cantina, and he asked if I wanted to
order something to eat. I said no and laid down cash for the beer.
—
I WALKED through the arched doorway with “La Cantina” written over it
next to a large-scale painting of a multicolored parrot and immediately sat at
the end of the curved counter, somewhat hidden by the trunk of the date palm
that rested in the middle of the bar, which was lined with shelves of alcohol
beneath a thatched hut dangling with white Christmas lights, and I saw them.
They were at a green-tiled table for two that overlooked Palm Canyon
Drive, a candle and an unopened menu between them—only one, because
Susan knew it so well. She had already ordered a margarita and it looked as if
Robert was having a Coke and the tableau seemed so innocent. She was
talking and he was listening, a Spanish-mission lantern hanging from the
column next to the table suffusing it with a dim orange glow, and a ceiling
fan rotated slowly above them and the mariachi band was on the stage bathed
in pink light, still quietly playing another Eagles song. I felt calm watching
Susan and Robert—a kind of relief instilled me with hope, because the
mystery of Susan and Robert seemed answered, and sighting them confirmed
something that had been gnawing at me for weeks that I could never figure
out. There was a truth now, and yet the numbing calm was diffused with a
distinct and sudden sadness. I stared at them while I was hidden at the bar
and realized it almost didn’t matter that I was there: the two of them were so
locked into each other they could have been anywhere, another country,
another planet—they only noticed each other, everyone else was invisible,
only the other one mattered. Susan was relaxed and Robert was suddenly
laughing and it was genuine—he seemingly wasn’t playing a role for her and
he looked happier than I’d ever seen him. And it was obvious they were a
couple—this was a date and not just two friends meeting up in Palm Springs
for a drink—there was a pronounced intimacy connecting them.
But what had I been expecting? Susan and Thom were never going to be
together forever in some kind of rosy fairy tale we had collectively dreamt
up: the cliché of an aspirational high-school romance starring the quarterback
and the most beautiful girl at Buckley. Susan had been moving away from
Thom for months now and Robert Mallory was simply the catalyst for her to
actually make the break. A version of this notion first struck me on that day
in Westwood last May when Susan said, “Thom isn’t dumb exactly…” and I
had seen so many instances even before Robert Mallory entered our lives:
pulling a hand away, an unfinished kiss, the Icehouse song, the bikini in the
supermarket—these had been clues emerging within a widening puzzle. The
sadness I felt was tied to Thom’s impending pain and it was something I
didn’t want to process: Thom didn’t deserve this. But, then, I thought, as the
fear started overriding my sadness: who deserved anything? We get what we
get.
—
SUSAN SAID something to Robert and he nodded, picking up the menu as
she pushed away from the table and stood up. I immediately slipped off the
stool and quickly headed back through the restaurant, and went to the pay
phone situated in a corridor where the restrooms were. I closed the door but
kept it ajar so the overhead fluorescent light wouldn’t reveal me and waited. I
briefly turned my face away when I saw Susan walking past the hostess stand
and toward the baño de mujeres, my heart beating fast, the adrenaline I’d
become used to that autumn shooting through my system, freezing me into a
heightened alertness. I was clutching the receiver and bowed over as Susan
passed by and then turned my head and watched as she entered the women’s
restroom. I hung up the phone and waited before I opened the door of the
booth and as if I was floating just landed in the middle of the foyer. A couple
walked in and were seated by the woman at the hostess stand while I zoned
out on a row of sombreros hanging on the wall and then looked up at the
swaying black iron chandelier and through the open doors I heard the wind
gusting along Palm Canyon, people lowering their heads as they walked
against it, and a tumbleweed flew across the highway, followed by another
one.
And in that moment I thought about leaving: just walking into the night
and getting in the car and driving back to L.A. and playing the tangible
participant and calling Debbie Schaffer and pretending that none of this ever
happened. It wasn’t my narrative anyway—it was Susan’s and Robert’s and
ultimately Thom’s. And yet I felt invested—weren’t we all connected as
classmates, and if something affected one of us then wouldn’t the others feel
the reverberations of our suffering and therefore console and protect us? But
in that moment I realized this wasn’t true. Because no one had been affected
by Matt Kellner’s death and my anguish. Everything was futile. There was no
hope. The world didn’t notice your pain. That familiar tide of anger crested
against me—the anger was actually a motivator—and I suddenly didn’t care
if Susan thought I was interfering with her secret life. On one level I
understood what she was trying to do—move away from the simplicity of
Thom, make herself happy, find another world, freedom, numbness as a
feeling. On another level it made me sick.
“What are you doing here?” I heard a voice ask.
—
I TURNED AROUND. Susan was facing me, staring blankly even though
there was a new hardness creasing her features. I didn’t know how long she’d
been standing there.
“Oh, hey,” I said, lamely pretending to be surprised. “I was just, um,
meeting my aunt for dinner and—”
“What are you doing here?” she asked again, interrupting me, stonefaced. She waited for an answer.
“Susan…” I finally said. It wasn’t entirely implausible that we would
both be in Palm Springs for the weekend but she knew there was something
wrong.
“Why are you here?” she asked, but it didn’t sound like a question
anymore. “What are you doing here?”
I stood in place, staring at her, frozen.
“Are you going to pretend you just ran into me?” She asked this in a soft
voice but I could tell from her eyes that she was furious.
I lifted my hands up and could only say her name again. “Susan…”
She hadn’t moved. She was standing very still, composing herself, a
statue, as she glared at me. “How did you find out?” she asked.
“Find out…what?” I asked back, dumbly.
“That I’m in Palm Springs,” she said in a flat voice.
“Susan, I…”
“Oh, fuck it, Bret.” Her eyes had watered and she raised a hand to the
side of her neck and held it there as if it was a position that would calm her.
“What are you doing? Do you want to ruin everything?”
“How long did you think you could keep this up?” I asked softly.
“Keep what up?” she asked with a visible annoyance.
“Whatever you’re doing here with Robert,” I said tonelessly in a hollow
voice. “Hiding this from Thom.” The moment suddenly seemed so intimate
that I was almost embarrassed for myself but I couldn’t turn away from her.
Susan suddenly looked shocked by the mention of Thom’s name and then
realized something and asked, “What did he tell you on the way to the airport
yesterday?”
I paused, staring at her, stuck, and then mumbled an answer.
“What?” she asked, glaring. “I couldn’t hear you.” She said this as if
reprimanding me, a teacher scolding a student.
“To keep an eye on you while he was gone,” I said, making my voice
clearer.
“Jesus,” she muttered. She kept the tensed hand on her neck.
“Susan, what’s happening—” I started.
She took a step forward. “Please don’t tell Thom.” The numb hard
woman suddenly morphed into a pleading little girl. “Please, I’m begging you
not to tell Thom.” She said this in a strained voice barely above a whisper,
and the way she asked this activated something in me.
“Tell Thom what?” I asked loudly. “What shouldn’t I tell Thom? That
you’re out here with Robert Mallory? Spending the weekend with Robert
Mallory? Susan, what in the fuck are you doing?” I stepped toward her.
“Don’t yell at me,” she said, glancing around, but there was no one near
us.
“What are you doing?” My voice also had a horrible pleading quality to
it now.
“Just promise me you won’t tell Thom,” she said, still glancing around
the foyer, and then back at me, guiltily.
“Promise not to tell him what?” I asked. I realized I was livid and that I
wanted to lash out and hurt her. “That you’re fucking Robert Mallory—”
“Oh, stop it,” Susan said, suddenly disgusted. “You don’t know
anything. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You sound like an idiot
—”
“What? I’m wrong?” I asked, incredulous. “You’re not?”
“Stop it—”
“Is he staying with you? Is he really staying with your grandparents?
Who do they think he is?” I asked. “A friend?”
“Yes,” she said. “Because he is. He is a friend.”
“I think he’s dangerous,” I said quietly. “I think he’s going to hurt you.”
“Why are you here?” she asked again, ignoring what I’d just said. “Why
do you want to ruin everything?”
“You’re ruining everything!” I shouted without realizing, then turned to
see what Susan was looking at: the hostess had returned to the stand and was
staring at me wide-eyed, shocked, and then shook her head before glancing
away. I stepped closer to Susan.
“I love you,” she was saying. “Do you understand that? I love you. I’ve
always loved you. I don’t know why I care so much but I’ve been feeling so
lost and…” She stopped, and waited, before she asked, “Do you love me, too,
Bret?”
“Yes, of course, yes,” I said, faltering. “You know that.”
“Then please promise me you won’t tell Thom,” she said.
“I hate Robert,” I said in a rush. “I hate him. I don’t understand why. But
I hate him. And I hate that you’re here with him. It makes me sick, Susan. It
makes me sick for Thom. It makes me sick for you. I hate him.” I was on the
verge of weeping. I could feel my face crumpling. I couldn’t control myself.
It just poured out of me.
“Bret, this isn’t about you,” Susan said calmly. “It doesn’t matter.”
“I hate him,” I said. “I think he did something to Matt—”
“Did something to Matt?” she asked, recoiling. “What are you talking
about?” This was the pleading voice again. “You sound crazy. You sound so
crazy when you say that.”
“But he’s crazy,” I said, unable to control my rambling. “I’m not the
crazy one. Robert is. He’s dangerous. He’s sick—”
“Shhh, Bret, please, you have to stop this,” she said. “You don’t know
anything. I can’t talk now but please just…” Desperation caused her to trail
off.
I closed my eyes and shook my head and helplessly acquiesced. “I
promise. I promise I won’t tell Thom.”
“I love you,” she said again.
“Don’t say that anymore,” I scowled. “He’s ruining everything. This is
going to wreck Thom—”
“Thom will be fine,” she said in a hushed voice.
“And it’s going to wreck whatever we had—”
“No, no Bret, it isn’t,” she said. “I have to go.”
I was losing it and I just wanted to end the conversation when I realized
it was actually over. I finally said, “Don’t tell Robert you ran into me. Don’t
tell him you just saw me. Don’t tell him you talked to me.”
Susan paused and then reached for my hand. I let her lift it up as she
clasped it.
“I don’t know if I can do that, Bret.” She said this in a controlled voice—
gentle but steady. “I’m with him—”
“If you tell him, then I can’t keep my promise,” I said, looking
hopelessly around—at anywhere but Susan in that moment. “I’ll keep your
secret. I won’t tell Thom that you were here but you can’t tell Robert you saw
me. Can you do that?” My eyes landed back on her.
She slowly nodded. “And you’ll never tell Thom?”
“If you don’t tell Robert you saw me…” I stopped, remembered
something. She waited. And then I said, echoing her, “Your secret is safe
with me.”
She quickly drew me into an embrace—it was tight and fierce—and then
let go and walked quickly away without saying goodbye and back toward the
cantina. I stumbled across Palm Canyon Drive, the Santa Anas guiding me as
I blindly walked into the parking lot, passing Robert’s Porsche, and then got
into my mom’s Jaguar and, through a scrim of tears, started driving to the
house on Toledo. I’d leave early the next morning and get back to L.A.
before noon.
—
AT SOME POINT on the drive from Las Casuelas to the house on Toledo—
which took only about ten minutes—I noticed a pair of headlights behind me
on East Palm Canyon Drive and I began to suspect someone was following
the Jaguar. The only reason this notion occurred: there was no one else out.
When I made a right onto La Verne Way, and it made the same turn, I
realized that the headlights belonged to a beige-colored van; I caught a
glimpse of it beneath a streetlamp in the side-view mirror. The paranoia was
so heavy that night that my mind began to trick me into thinking that the
beige-colored van was, in fact, trailing after me and that it wasn’t headed
anywhere else—that it was homed in on the Jaguar and it wanted to know
where I was going, where I resided, where I’d be sleeping for the night,
where it could find me later, so someone could wear a ski mask and hold a
butcher knife while standing over the bed and in a groaning drawl ask me if I
wanted to die, the eyes wide with madness and hunger.
I was paying attention to the rearview mirror and barely looking at the
road, only concentrating on the headlights behind me, when I veered into the
oncoming traffic lane. But there was no one out, and as I veered back into my
lane another wave of dread overcame me and I felt nauseous and I needed to
take a Valium to quell the panic and, nearing the house on Toledo, I started
wishing away everything that had happened that night—I was actually
praying. I looked back into the rearview mirror: the van was still slowly
gliding behind me. Don’t be a pussy, I heard Ryan Vaughn’s voice, and my
heart cracked. As I turned into the driveway of my aunt’s house I expected
the beige-colored van to slow down but it didn’t—the van just simply drove
by as I sat there in the Jaguar, a mess, on the verge of tears, wiped out by the
dread my paranoia had activated, and by Susan, and by Robert, and what was
going to happen to Thom, and by the dead girls, and the Trawler, and Matt
Kellner. The van just kept driving forward, moving along Toledo, fading
away from me, and I watched until its taillights disappeared. You. Had.
Imagined. Something. I almost whimpered with relief as the wind gently
rocked the car. I was so sickly exhausted that I trudged to the master bedroom
without turning any of the lights in the living room or patio off and closed the
sliding glass doors leading out to the pool and took two of the Valiums I had
brought and started to fall asleep listening to the wind outside gusting over
the desert.
And before I drifted off I realized I had seen the beige-colored van a
number of places during the fall of 1981: in the Buckley parking lot the night
the Griffin was desecrated, on the third floor of the Galleria’s garage on the
first day of school when Robert followed me across Ventura Boulevard, in
the alley behind the space on Melrose the night the girl was scratched by the
hippie. These three remembered sightings led my mind to flash on many
more, a few that I thought were real, but some of these flashes weren’t
verified, they were imagined. That night in Palm Springs was the first time I
became aware that there was something sinister about the beige-colored van
and that its presence was a reminder, another example, of everything that was
careening out of control that fall. And it was the first time I vaguely
connected it to Robert Mallory. I don’t know why—there was no proof that
linked them—but somehow, I knew, the beige van was about him. There was
a link—I just didn’t know what it was yet.
—
A FAINT CRASHING SOUND woke me up. Something had tipped over
outside and shattered. I thought maybe the wind had toppled one of the large
and empty terra-cotta pots in the backyard onto the concrete patio—the Santa
Anas were louder than earlier, occasionally screaming as they swept over the
desert. I looked out through the sliding glass doors of the master bedroom
and realized everything was black—the lights I had left on were out, and
there was no glow emanating from the hallway leading into the master
bedroom or spilling onto the patio, which meant that the lights I’d left on in
the living room and the foyer were off as well. And I knew that I hadn’t
turned them off before I fell asleep. The Valium helped me remain calm as I
reached for the phone next to the lamp—but the line was dead, and just a hint
of the familiar dread drifted over me. My first thought: a power outage
caused by the winds had darkened the house. But when I got up and slowly
moved toward the living room, running a hand along the wall to help guide
me through the darkness, I could suddenly see past the panels of glass on
either side of the front door that the streetlamps and other entranceways on
Toledo were lit. I had fallen asleep with my watch on, and when I pressed the
side of the face the digital numbers lit up and told me it was three-thirty. I
stood in what was an almost total darkness—the only light was faint and
either coming from Toledo and through the panels of glass or from the high
desert moon that dimly lit the house, forming shadows and silhouettes once
my eyes adjusted: I could see the outline of the large ficus in the backyard
bending in the wind, the hedge behind it that separated the house from the
desert, the dark rectangle of the pool, but there were no colors, nothing was
distinct. I moved from wall to wall, finding various light switches and
uselessly flipping them up and down: nothing. Everything was dead. The
sound of the wind would ratchet up, boom across the desert and then fade
away into a momentary silence before sounding again.
I gave up and turned and headed to the bedroom, where I knew I could
easily fall back into a hazy Valium sleep, but froze when a beam of light
slowly started moving across the living room.
—
SOMEONE was by the pool holding a flashlight and making their way across
the windswept patio and the beam continued traversing across the walls of
the darkened living room, occasionally stopping on a piece of furniture as if it
had landed on something it thought was important. The beam moved across
the glass coffee table and the white shag rug and then moved along the
bookshelves that were connected to the hallway I’d stepped back into, which
led to the master bedroom. The beam left the living room and from my
vantage point at the end of the hallway I saw the light slowly appear again,
enlarging as it moved across the patio and then crawled along the floor of the
bedroom, until it landed on the bed and stopped suddenly, as if it was
surprised that the bed was empty, that there was no one in it, that whoever
had been in it was gone. The light then moved back and forth over the bed
from one side of the room to the other, like it was searching for something,
and then it stopped, confused, when it landed on the Gucci backpack I’d
brought with me.
Whoever was holding the flashlight moved away from the sliding glass
door of the master bedroom and started creeping through the yard toward the
patio and back to the side of the house where the kitchen was. I moved into
the living room, following the light, and watched as it suddenly waved across
the walls and traversed the bookshelves again.
My mind was fumbling: I thought it might have been a security guard
from the Canyon Estates, but they would have rung the doorbell and they
wouldn’t have been prowling the backyard. The light remained still and then
suddenly jerked over to where I was standing, and I instinctively ducked to
the floor, hiding from it.
The beam paused, lingering, and then I watched as the light slowly
moved from across the living room wall, traveling toward the kitchen,
sometimes stopping before it started moving again, trailing the floor, then the
ceiling.
Through the Valium and sleep daze I finally realized with a sickening
jolt: whoever was out there was looking for the person in the house. There
was a car in the driveway. There was an unmade bed. They were wondering:
where was the person residing here? There were dozens of empty houses
lining Toledo that night waiting to be robbed, but this person had chosen this
particular house because someone was in it, my mind screamed.
The beam of light crossed the living room again, purposefully lingering
in corners where the terrified victim might be pressed against a wall, hiding. I
was still on the floor, shaking so hard I couldn’t control it. But it was more
frightening not to know where this person was, and I slowly lifted my head so
I could keep my eyes on the flashlight.
—
THERE WAS NO other light from the backyard—not from the patio, not
from the pool—and I kept wondering who this person could be and what they
wanted and why they had chosen this house. It was just a barely discernible
shape behind a white beam of light—I couldn’t see anything else. The wind
was suddenly battering the sliding glass doors, screaming again, and then,
just as suddenly, it subsided.
The light was now moving back to the bedroom—it changed course on
its way to the kitchen. The beam scoured the pool and ran across the outdoor
shower, the ficus trees, the Moroccan-tiled fountain.
I realized I’d been so afraid that I hadn’t even known it—the fear had
been so massive and abstract—and now it was specific, and this caused me to
stand, hunched, and glance over at the front door, figuring out an escape.
It was totally silent in the house as the light returned to the living room
and started scanning it again.
I dropped and crawled to a space behind one of the sofas and in my fear
shouted out something—not a word, not for help, not a warning, just a sound,
garbled and high-pitched.
The beam froze and then the light frantically moved across the shag
carpet and along the couch, trying to locate where the sound came from. The
light immediately landed on the sofa, but I was behind it and couldn’t be
seen, and then the light stopped, as if it realized something.
I was pressed against the back of the couch, breathing raggedly,
paralyzed, barely able to contain the fear—I looked over at the front door
again. The wind momentarily picked up and then it was silent. I waited,
uselessly hoping this was a dream that I’d be waking from soon, but knew
with an awful certainty it wasn’t. I didn’t know if I’d been targeted and if this
person was an actual threat and I didn’t want to find out by provoking them.
But I couldn’t help myself and I emitted the strangled cry again.
—
I STARTED SLOWLY CRAWLING across the living-room floor toward the
hallway leading to the master bedroom, everything shrouded in darkness, and
then I stood up and stumbled along the hallway toward the bedroom’s
entrance, again using my hand to guide me.
I just needed the keys to the car—that’s all I was focusing on. They were
on the nightstand by the bed. I didn’t need anything else. I’d drive back to
L.A. in just the T-shirt and underwear I’d been sleeping in if I had to.
The beam of light from behind the sliding glass doors was now tracing
the headboard and then the wall above the bed, and I dropped down to the
floor just before the doorway that led into the master bedroom. I was shaking
so badly I couldn’t stay still, but I forced myself to wait. And in those
moments the beam disappeared.
I kept waiting. Just the sound of the wind could be heard. And then the
beam reappeared, aimed at the ceiling, and I could hear another noise besides
the wind and I didn’t know what it was at first.
It was just a tapping sound, even and rhythmic, but slow: something was
tapping against the glass of the sliding doors.
When I looked up at the round beam of light moving forward and
backward across the ceiling I realized that the person outside was slowly
tapping the flashlight on the glass door that led into the master bedroom.
It was teasing, it was a warning, they were waiting for me to show
myself and make a move for the keys.
I was so frightened I shouted out “Robert!” and then I shouted it again:
“Robert!”
I’m not even sure I thought it was Robert Mallory at that point—it was
just what I landed on in the moment, it was just panic. Because of this the
light automatically clicked off—the beam disappeared. Suddenly it was gone.
I waited for it to come back but it didn’t appear again.
I couldn’t move for what seemed like an hour, just listening to the wind,
trying to calm myself down. When I looked back at my watch I was stunned
to see it was only three-thirty-seven. The entire ordeal—from when I awoke
to the moment I looked at the watch—had lasted barely seven minutes.
I grabbed the backpack and the car keys and ran from the house and
drove out of Palm Springs only wearing my T-shirt and underwear and
arrived back in L.A. at dawn, as the sun began rising over the city.
20
WHEN I PULLED UP to the empty house on Mulholland early that Sunday
morning I immediately noticed that the mailbox at the bottom of the
driveway was open and there was something inside it: a Maxell cassette. I
first thought it was left there by Debbie Schaffer—a mixtape filled with
songs that she imagined meant something to me, music that commented on
our relationship, and what we had supposedly built together since June, the
girlfriend-boyfriend thing. A pang of apprehension and guilt flowered within
me as I pulled the cassette out of the mailbox and tossed it onto the passenger
seat, and then continued up the driveway, opened the garage and parked the
Jaguar. I could hear Shingy’s excited barking from within the house as I got
out of the car and slumped against it, imagining the messages waiting for me
on the answering machine from Debbie, left on Saturday night, asking where
I was and why I wasn’t picking up. I wondered if, by now, she knew I’d been
in Palm Springs, if Susan had called her when she got back to the house on
Silverado and told Debbie about the confrontation in Las Casuelas. I also, in
that moment, in the garage, truly didn’t care. The Santa Anas rattled the
garage door and I realized I had zoned out and needed sleep.
—
I WATCHED AS the dog ran circles across the lawn in the morning light,
seemingly delighted by the hot winds that gusted across it—leaping and
barking at them—as much as he was by my return. I left the kitchen door
open so he could come back inside and then walked tiredly to my bedroom,
where I placed the cassette on my desk and dropped the Gucci backpack by
the bed and almost immediately fell asleep. When I woke up it was two in the
afternoon and my thoughts were about Susan and Robert, as if I was still
dreaming about them—fucking each other, naked, in one of the guest
bedrooms of her grandparents’ house, the winds howling, Susan’s breasts, the
nipples stiffened and wet with Robert’s saliva, Robert’s pale ass pumping
into her, their mutual cries of ecstasy; my hard-on was throbbing and I jerked
off quickly to these images to get rid of them—but I couldn’t, even after I
came. I was dreading Thom’s return, and frightened about the following day
at Buckley without him there, the endless pantomime of it all: pretending we
were in someone else’s dream, a place where I hadn’t seen Susan in Palm
Springs with Robert that weekend. I reached over and pushed PLAY on the
answering machine: Debbie leaving two messages on Saturday night—
disappointed, then perturbed—along with one from my mother, who was
somewhere still in Greece, and a number of hang-ups. I lay back and stared at
the Elvis Costello poster adjacent to the bed: TRUST.
There had been a point along the line in the last seven weeks where
Susan had fallen in love with Robert Mallory and I couldn’t have imagined
anything more hopeless happening than this—at least socially—because it
could only be hidden for so long and once it was revealed everything would
get altered, everyone’s relationships would become rearranged, sides would
be chosen and this would completely change the mood of our senior year, and
I was afraid it would ruin Thom, no matter how sunny and strong he appeared
on the surface. There was a widening crack that Thom hadn’t paid attention
to—and it was going to swallow him up. Everything would curdle, become
bitter, it would be our only point of reference, the world would die. The one
person who had known about this so far was Debbie Schaffer, and as I lay
there in bed on that Sunday afternoon I suddenly resented her because she
had seen what the outcome was going to be at a point long before I did and
hadn’t warned anybody. She had known that everyone was going to find out
and this made her guilty in my eyes; she was so entitled and so careless.
What did she expect from me? I thought angrily as I wiped the semen off my
dick and stomach with a Kleenex. Had she really spent hours creating a
mixtape that would detail her feelings about me in twenty-four songs and did
she really expect me to be touched by this? And then the flow of emotion
stopped and my eyes landed on the cassette across the room on the desk that
she had left for me while I was in Palm Springs and I realized something: I
had only assumed it was a mixtape Debbie had made, but there wasn’t a case
with a listing of the songs on side A and side B along with the geometric
shapes Debbie favored, which often dotted the title of each track, and I only
then noted that there had been something else wrong. I pushed myself off the
bed and walked to the desk and looked down at the Maxell cassette.
Someone had misspelled my name with two “T”s. BRETT. And it wasn’t
Debbie’s handwriting.
—
I STARED AT THE CASSETTE for a long time without picking it up
because I suddenly didn’t want to touch it if it wasn’t from Debbie. I thought
hopefully, uselessly, for just one moment, that it was from Ryan—that maybe
he’d had a change of heart about us, that maybe the extra “T” was a private
joke, a cassette filled with Bob Seger and Springsteen songs—but knew that
was impossible. There was something wrong about the cassette. When a
wave of hunger-induced nausea hit me I realized I was starving and left the
bedroom and walked to the kitchen, where I looked through the fridge and
pulled out a bowl of pasta Rosa had prepared and picked at it while looking at
the Santa Anas rippling the pool and Shingy splayed on the lawn beneath the
afternoon sun, his fur tousled by the winds, and I just stood in the kitchen,
standing in place by the island, for a very long time, slowly eating the penne
with my fingers, before I realized I had to walk back to the bedroom—
something forced me to—and immediately picked up the cassette and slipped
it into the tape deck of my stereo. I pushed PLAY and then sat at my desk and
waited.
I had expected a song but there was nothing at first—just silence—then a
gradual buzz, a humming, and I thought maybe this was the beginning of the
first track. I leaned over to adjust the volume but couldn’t hear anything else,
and I was distracted by the wind from outside, until I realized the wind was
also coming from the speakers in my bedroom. The wind had been recorded.
But there was no other sound and the wind didn’t seem to be announcing a
song. I sat very still, listening, leaning forward, my ear tilted toward one of
the speakers, and I could barely make out the other sound: distant waves
crashing across a shoreline somewhere. And this was soon accompanied by
something else that I couldn’t quite make out and that I first thought was
static, before I changed my mind, and realized it was the sound of a fire
crackling. But the wind outside my bedroom was competing with the sounds
coming from the speakers and I looked around for my Walkman, then
remembered it was in the makeshift gym, on the tray of the treadmill, where I
retrieved it and pulled a Billy Idol cassette out. When I walked back to the
bedroom the sound of wind and waves was still emanating from the speakers.
I pressed STOP and pulled the Maxell cassette out and placed it in the
Walkman and situated the earphones carefully over my head and listened.
Three minutes passed and there was nothing except waves cresting along a
shoreline, distant and faint, and the wind occasionally gusting, dominating
the soundtrack, and the muted crackling of a fire. And then finally there was
what sounded like a voice and I thought at first it was saying “See it…see
it…” but I couldn’t hear it clearly enough to make sure if those were the
exact words. The sound got clearer on the Walkman and I realized that the
voice wasn’t saying “See it…see it…” but actually “Eat it…eat it…”
—
THIS VOICE WAS horrible, and even though it sounded as if it was coming
from a young man it was also a pretend voice, groaning and quavering, a
Halloween voice, someone trying to scare you. It kept instructing whoever it
was with to “eat it” and then paused so you heard what sounded like
someone weeping, trying to contain themselves, but failing and then
collapsing back into the weeping, and then they were trying to speak, as if
confused or under the influence of some monstrous thing that left them
blasted and weakened. “I…don’t…want…to…eat…it…” the other voice
said, strained with tears, between intakes of breath. “Eat it, eat it,” the
pretend voice hissed, a man mimicking an exaggerated crone—the voice was
slightly mushy, as if the mouth was filled with food—and when there was a
pause it was just the waves and the wind and the sound of burning logs until
the horrible voice said approvingly “Yesshhhh, thasssh good, yesshhh,” and
then the mic was moved so you could hear the scared person chewing on
something and the chewing was interrupted by crying and then another sound
could be heard—the microphone passing over the crackling of the fire, and
then the waves were crashing again. I tried to imagine who these people were
and where this was being recorded: they were on a beach, it was windy, they
were sitting next to a fire, so it was probably night, and why was this
exchange being recorded. Was it written? Was it staged? Were these actors
following a script?
The fake monster voice kept urging the other person again to “eat it…eat
it…” and the boy’s voice said, while weeping, “I’m afraid…I’m…scared…
what are those lights…oh, man…” There was a pause where you could just
hear the boy groaning until the thing urged, “Eat…thish…one…” The boy’s
crying continued and then he started pleading, haltingly, as if he was
struggling to get the words out: “Take off…the…mask…please…take the…
mask off…,” and after a deep and choking intake of breath pleading again,
“Please…take off…the…mask…” “Eat it…Eat thish one…,” the Halloween
voice commanded, as if it was offering the boy something outstretched in a
claw. I could hear the chewing sounds again and then the weeping as the boy
said something, his mouth filled with whatever he was eating: “I’m scared…
I’m so cold…” “EAT IT,” the voice shrieked, “EAT IT.” There was a
retching sound, followed by coughing, and then the boy wept, “I’m sorry…
I’m sorry…” and then “…please…please take the…mask off…” And then
the boy’s voice was racked with convulsions as if he was shivering
uncontrollably, “I-I-I’m s-s-so co-cold…” he said. I realized at a certain
moment, in the chair at my desk, that this was real—this wasn’t something
acted out. It wasn’t a joke. Whatever had been recorded was genuine: there
was too much fear in the boy’s voice. And I was suddenly afraid as well,
more than I’d ever been.
—
A LONG SILENCE BETWEEN THE VOICES FOLLOWED—just the
crackling of the fire, the waves in the ocean, the booming wind—and I
realized that whatever was sitting across from the boy had handed him
something that the boy was now eating and chewing on, and that was the
moment I realized it was the fish from Matt Kellner’s aquarium. I clutched
myself, completely frozen, listening as Matt kept weeping and the pretend
voice kept telling him to “eat it…EAT IT…” This back and forth went on for
twenty minutes, while Matt gradually got higher, like he was tripping and the
intensity of it was frightening him, reducing him to a child. I stared out the
window through the slats of the venetian blinds and onto the lawn in the
backyard and I kept stopping myself from fast-forwarding to the end, because
even though I couldn’t bear it I had to hear the thing play out. “Take…off
the…mask…” Matt kept asking, sounding helpless, bewildered. “Eat it,” the
voice insisted. Matt said something I couldn’t hear and I rewound the tape
and pressed PLAY again. Matt, sounding increasingly like a child, was saying,
“But…it’s still…alive…please…” “EAT IT!” the voice commanded. The
mic was adjusted so you could hear Matt chewing on the fish that the thing
kept handing him. And then there was a click and music started playing, an
elaborate piano riff that was automatically familiar—I knew it but couldn’t
place it at first. “Sing the song…” and Matt, weeping, tried to sing,
encouraged by the awful voice. The wind died down, the waves paused, and
only the crackling of the flames could be heard, and then I recognized “Year
of the Cat” by Al Stewart and the ghastly voice asked “Did…you like the
cock?” Matt just wept. “It’s so cold…” “Did you like inserting the cock in
your anus?” the voice wheezed. Matt kept crying.
“Sing the song…” the voice gurgled. Matt started singing in a light voice
and you could hear him trembling and the shaking got worse so it sounded
like he was vibrating as he was singing along with the song but he couldn’t
sing the lyrics coherently, he didn’t know the lyrics, he was just making
noises, trying to hum along with it. “I’m afraid,” he said again, and you could
hear the tears. “I’m s-s-scared.” “Did you like sucking the cock?” the voice
asked. “Did you like the cock in your asshole?” There was an interruption
and the mic was adjusted again. And then I heard the first slapping sound but
Matt wasn’t protesting or crying out because the “massive amount” of
lysergic acid diethylamide finally swallowed him up and he was lost in the
fear of another world now, hypnotized by it. “Year of the Cat” kept playing,
interrupted by the slapping sounds—this was the noise of something striking
Matt, across his back and face and chest, along with his calm weeping. I
realized that Matt was naked and that something flat and smooth was making
contact with his flesh—these were where the bruises came from. The waves
kept crashing in the background, rhythmic and timed with the slapping
sounds, the water crested along the shore, and then ebbed out, and there
would be a silence, and in the pause where another wave formed, the slapping
would sound out again. This was Matt naked by a bonfire on Crystal Cove
beach, the ghoul next to him recording this. “The lights…” Matt finally wept.
“Oh God, the lights…”
And then the tape abruptly ended. I was so mesmerized and frozen with
horror that it took me longer than it should have to realize I was going to be
sick. I ripped the Walkman off my head and lurched away from the desk,
knocking the chair over, and stumbled to the bathroom.
21
MY INITIAL THOUGHT on that afternoon when I first heard the tape—a
recording made on the last night of Matt Kellner’s life—was to burn it. I
thought about this even before I contemplated taking it to the police. At one
point that afternoon I drove to Haskell Avenue and was going to slip the
cassette into Ronald and Sheila Kellner’s mailbox—wipe my fingerprints off
it and let them deal with this—but by the time I pulled up in front of the
house I’d changed my mind. I couldn’t figure it out but there was a reason
why I didn’t want anyone to hear it—there was something tainted about this
piece of evidence that stopped me from going to the authorities or to the
Kellners. Instead, I called Jeff Taylor from a phone booth on Ventura
Boulevard that Sunday afternoon and asked if he had any weed or Quaaludes
and Jeff confirmed he had both and he’d bring them to Buckley the following
day, but I needed them now and told him I’d drive out to Malibu. I made my
way across Topanga Canyon until I hit Pacific Coast Highway and sped out
to the Colony, where Jeff met me in front of the gates—he would’ve invited
me in, he said, but his dad was watching football games totally wasted and
warned he didn’t want any guests around when Jeff mentioned I was coming
over. I could barely maintain a casual façade in front of Jeff for even the
moment it took to make the exchange and I just nodded and quickly said,
“It’s okay, dude, I gotta run.” I threw the bag of Quaaludes onto the
passenger seat next to the cassette.
I never wanted to hear the tape again but I didn’t want it out of my sight
either and it started to dawn on me why I didn’t want anyone else to hear it,
at least for now. I was positive that Robert Mallory had recorded it and that
he had been playing a kind of game with Matt—Robert manic, Matt wasted
—and somehow this game got out of hand as it kept escalating until Matt was
dead, with Matt never knowing that Robert had been institutionalized or
having any idea how unstable he was. The only solace I felt was that, at one
point, I had warned Matt about Robert. Procuring the drugs relaxed me
enough so that I could drive steadily from Malibu with a minimal amount of
anxiety, and once in the empty house on Mulholland I smoked a few bowls of
grass and then took a full Quaalude and everything got erased and I was able
to fall asleep without thinking about the horrible sounds coming from my
Walkman earlier that afternoon. I dreamt about nothing that night and woke
up groggy as Rosa knocked on my door the following morning, reminding
me I’d be late to school, and it sounded like such an innocent concern
compared to what had happened over that weekend I almost smiled.
—
MONDAY. I PARKED THE Jaguar on Stansbury. I already knew what my
plan was for that afternoon as I listened to the rest of “Time for Me to Fly”—
still stoned from the Quaalude I had taken last night and the weed I’d smoked
that morning, and, walking up to the gates of the school, I stumbled on the
rise leading into the parking lot. I was late—too long in the shower, zoning
out while getting dressed, traffic on Beverly Glen—and tried to walk more
quickly but then just relaxed into an easy stride, thinking: who cared if I was
late? I didn’t want to be there anyway, nothing mattered; yesterday I’d
listened to a boy being tortured on a beach. There was a cassette tape in a
drawer in my bedroom that eradicated everything: why should I have to be on
time for an English class, why should I take notes or study for the test, why
should I care about the novel assigned? I made it to Mr. Robbins just as the
bells were chiming and stopped for a moment after I opened the door, about
to enter the classroom. Susan Reynolds was sitting at her desk and next to her
was the desk where I usually sat but today I didn’t want to sit next to Susan,
who looked up from her notebook and was staring at me blankly. Another
realization: I didn’t want trouble. I didn’t want to break the dream of the
pantomime. I tried to transform into the tangible participant and smiled. I
noted that, two rows over, Ryan Vaughn hadn’t looked up from the
paperback folded in his hands.
“Mr. Ellis?” Robbins asked hesitantly. “Could you please take a seat?”
“Sure,” I said, and walked over to the desk next to Susan’s and smiled at
her. She subtly cocked her head and smiled back: it was natural, and numb,
and totally guileless.
“Hey,” she said blankly as I sat down.
“Hey,” I said, still smiling, placing the Gucci backpack on the desktop.
“You okay?” she asked.
“Yeah,” I said, glancing at her. “You okay?” Her eyes gave away
nothing. She was utterly calm. Saturday night in Palm Springs had been
erased between the two of us.
“I’m fine,” she said.
“Okay,” I said, pulling out a notebook from the backpack.
The dream was put into play—we helped in its creation—and I floated
along with it. Both morning classes passed by quickly, and then I joined
Susan as we walked up to assembly in the courtyard below the Pavilion.
Debbie kissed me lightly on the lips and all I could register: Thom Wright’s
absence wasn’t even that noticeable. After assembly the three of us chatted—
that’s the term, chatted; that’s what it was, chatting—until Susan left for the
girls’ locker room to suit up for Phys Ed. Debbie wanted to talk and I
patiently held back while noticing Robert Mallory and Ryan Vaughn walking
toward the boys’ locker room together, talking animatedly; Ryan gestured as
if something was exploding, making a face; Robert laughed. An acid pang
flowered in my chest but I didn’t let it distract me from focusing intently on
Debbie, who reminded me about her father’s party on Saturday night at the
mansion on Stone Canyon, and I assured her I would definitely be coming,
and then she asked what I did over the weekend and why hadn’t I answered
any of her phone calls or called back. I stared at her before formulating an
answer. She became impatient.
“This is a difficult question, I know,” she said, with a whisper of
sarcasm. “Remembering what you did this weekend.”
I realized in that moment that I wasn’t sure if she knew I’d been to Palm
Springs and that I’d seen Susan with Robert there. I realized: Debbie would
have confronted me with this if Susan had told her. Or she was testing me.
We were lost in the maze of the pantomime.
“Well, if you want to know the truth—” I started.
“No, I want the lie, Bret,” she said, again sarcastically, and then, “Of
course I want to know the truth.”
“I worked on my book and got stoned,” I said simply. “That’s all I did
this weekend.”
She studied my face before she asked, “Really?”
“Yeah, just got wasted all weekend long,” I said. “I bought a bag of weed
and some ’ludes from Jeff and just got wasted and wrote.” I shrugged. “It was
fun. I like having weekends like that sometimes.”
“You didn’t go anywhere?” she asked in a faraway voice, thinking things
through.
“No, I didn’t,” I said. “Why?”
She just stared at me not saying anything.
“Come on, we’re going to be late.” I reached for her hand so we could
end the conversation before it headed into specifics. She took the hand
hesitantly.
“Bret…” she started.
“Yeah?” I waited, my arm outstretched.
Debbie forced a smile and said, “It’s nothing.”
I pulled her forward and we walked to the locker rooms together.
—
AFTER CHANGING into the red shorts and a Griffins T-shirt for PE, I
waited in the boys’ locker room until I was sure Debbie had already walked
up to Gilley Field because I wanted to be alone. I didn’t want to interact with
the script Susan and Debbie had devised, so I waited ten minutes sitting on a
bench—all the guys were already gone—staring at Thom Wright’s locker and
I involuntarily reached out to touch the small silver padlock that hung there
and understood that he would never grasp my tender feelings toward him. I
trudged up the steep hill leading to the field rather than taking the elevator
and as I walked toward the track I saw Ryan jogging lazily around it, by
himself, and then noticed that today was coed and Debbie and Susan and
Robert were standing by the tennis courts just talking casually, as if it was
last month, as if there was nothing signifying that a dramatic event was
forming itself among the three of them, as if they were all actors in a play;
Thom was gone but they were still careful. Katie Harris and Tracy Goldman
were playing tennis behind them, and I looked up at the bleachers, where I
was going to sit and read Joan Didion for the remainder of the period, and
spotted Michelle and Nancy and Rita lying on the first tier of benches,
sunning themselves. I realized it would look strange if I didn’t walk over and
say hi to Debbie and Susan even though the thought of getting close to
Robert Mallory made me dizzy with apprehension mixed with an awful
desire that still pulsed within me despite everything I knew about what he had
done to Matt. I watched as Anthony Matthews and Doug Furth tossed a
football and I must have zoned out standing in place, because I suddenly
noticed Ryan was in front of me, lightly panting, his face misted with sweat.
The last thing I’d remembered was a boom box playing something off Pink
Floyd’s The Wall.
“Hey,” he said. “You okay?”
“Um, yeah,” I said, looking up at him, dazed.
“You were just standing there spacing out,” he said. “I thought maybe
something was wrong.”
His presence activated me. “I wanted to talk to you.”
“Yeah?” Ryan said apprehensively. “About what?”
“Yeah,” I started. “I just want to let you know that I’m totally fine with
everything and I don’t—I really don’t—want to cause any drama and I’m
sorry if I have.” I paused. “I thought I was more cool than that but I guess I’m
not so—”
“Oh, that’s okay,” Ryan interrupted quickly.
“No, really, I don’t want there to be any problems between us,” I said.
Ryan glanced around the field, but we were far away from everyone and
no one could hear us.
“So, you know, I get it, we’re friends and that’s how it should be,” I
continued. “So from now on we’re cool, right?”
“Yeah.” Ryan nodded. “Thanks.”
“Do you want to see a movie or something?” I suddenly asked.
“Yeah, that would be great.” He said this with a genuineness that briefly
delighted me.
“Want to do it this afternoon?” I ventured.
“Um, I can’t this afternoon,” he said. “But what about tomorrow?”
“Great, yeah,” I said. “Tomorrow.”
“Cool,” he said.
“Okay,” I said. “I’ll look and see what’s playing.”
Without saying anything else, he jogged away, leaving me standing by
myself, and I started walking across the field to where Susan and Debbie and
Robert stood, and soon I noticed that the conversation suddenly stopped
while I neared the tennis courts and the three of them just looked at me and
benignly smiled as I got closer. They were all wearing the red shorts and the
Griffin T-shirts and Wayfarers—and so good-looking they could have been
the popular teen villains in a high-school exploitation movie. “Hey, guys,” I
said, loose and, I hoped, engaged, joining them. “What’s going on?” and then
added, “Everyone’s looking really hot today.” This didn’t land in the right
way and Robert took off his sunglasses and smiled at me quizzically. “What
were you talking about?” I asked, trying to appear both casual and as if I was
actually interested, but feeling neither.
“Oh, just talking about Terry’s party Saturday night,” Susan said,
pushing her sunglasses up onto her forehead. “Who’s going to be there,
y’know.” She stared blankly at me. “You coming?” she asked.
“Oh yeah, it’s gonna be cool,” I said. Debbie leaned in to me and I let
her.
“That is, if you’re not too wasted to show up,” Debbie teased, nudging
my side.
“What did you do this weekend, Bret?” Susan asked with a jokey
knowingness that was supposed to have me confirm what I’m sure Debbie
had already told them.
“I had fun,” I said, shrugging, and then, staring at Susan. “It’s a secret.”
“Apparently not,” Susan said, without a beat, smiling at me.
“I worked on my book,” I said, explaining this to Robert. “I took drugs
and worked on my book.” He looked at me, confused. “I do that sometimes.”
“Oh,” Robert said, not knowing what else to say, then hesitantly added,
“Cool.”
I drifted away from the ensuing conversation—I was just studying faces.
If I was required to say something I did. If I was required to react to
something I did. I laughed when required. I agreed with something when I
was supposed to. I offered a similar opinion about something that the three of
them agreed on. I was able to look into Robert Mallory’s beautiful face on
that day and there was no one hiding behind the eyes and yet I was electrified
standing so close to the person who had essentially helped, I thought, kill
Matt Kellner, and it took all the strength I possessed not to confront him and
let Robert know what I suspected. His nonchalance and his handsomeness
were even more distinct when contrasted with his madness—this was the
normal boy who made the horrible voice taunting Matt, this was the popular
boy wearing some kind of mask that Matt wanted him to take off, this was
the boy in love with Susan Reynolds making Matt eat the fish that were
ultimately found inside him, this was the boy slapping Matt with some kind
of object that left the bruises. I tried picturing the scene that played out at
Crystal Cove in front of the bonfire and was verified on the cassette but I
couldn’t imagine visually what had happened—and what made it worse was
that I had to guess, and that’s when the writer’s fantasies were more alarming
than what mundane reality probably offered and I had to shut it out.
You couldn’t tell that Susan and Robert were a couple that morning on
Gilley Field because they’d cast themselves and were now performing in
different, more innocent roles, and yet because of this the fake rapport
between the four of us eased into something that seemed almost genuine.
This happened even though I knew Debbie and Susan and Robert were liars
and it ignited my increasing disgust at the girls for protecting a maniac but
especially at Susan for having fallen in love with him, and this was going to
cause her to break up with Thom. This fact simply silenced me: it was too big
to fight and there was nothing to win. It was already happening. For about
five minutes the volume was lowered and I only concentrated on their faces
and then I heard Debbie talking about Spirit and the equestrian event at the
Windover Stables and again who was slated to show up at Stone Canyon on
Saturday night, and Robert was relaxed and mostly just nodding as the girls
talked, his particular scent drifting toward me—sandalwood and cedar—and I
imagined licking his armpit—and when Susan admitted she’d been in Palm
Springs for the weekend, staying at her grandparents’, this seemed to be only
for my benefit. And then I couldn’t help myself.
“You were in Palm Springs, too, right?” I asked Robert casually.
“How did you know?” Robert asked, trying to downplay his surprise—
not that I knew he’d been in Palm Springs but that I actually asked this in
front of Susan and Debbie.
“I was going to see if you wanted to go to a movie and your aunt told me
you were in Rancho Mirage,” I said.
“Right,” Robert said, nodding. “She told me you called.” He said
tonelessly, “I would’ve totally gone to a movie with you.”
Susan was just staring at me, not saying anything. Debbie knew that they
had been in Palm Springs together and yet seemingly didn’t know that I had
been there as well, and Robert was also unaware of this fact, or so I thought
—if Susan had kept her promise to me. Maybe it was better this way, I was
thinking, at least for now: play it dumb, just keep the pantomime revolving,
admit nothing, say your lines, move offstage, wait for another cue. But I still
couldn’t help myself.
“You talk to Thom?” I asked Susan.
“No,” she said coolly without a pause. “I haven’t.”
The dream continued throughout the rest of the day. It carried over into
lunch, and there was something so much easier about following the rules of
the dream rather than confronting the reality of the situation, and I just sat
with both girls at the center table below the shadow of the Pavilion and tried
to eat the lunch that Rosa had prepared for me and that I kept trying to
concentrate on—the tuna-fish sandwich on wheat bread, the Lay’s potato
chips, a few Famous Amos cookies, an orange—but there was another
moment when I saw Robert and Ryan Vaughn conferring by the steps leading
up to the courtyard, and the sight of them together completely unnerved me
and it was a reminder of all the times I saw Robert with Matt Kellner and I
shuddered when I envisioned a similar fate for Ryan. Robert bounded up the
steps to our table and sat next to Susan and again the four of us engaged in
the kind of useless banter the pantomime encouraged. It was then, during
lunch, at the center table, below the Pavilion, overlooking the courtyard, that
I felt Thom’s absence even more strongly, and I looked around at the other
senior tables and realized maybe no one felt this way except me—I was the
only one who truly missed him and I was also the one most concerned about
his happiness, his outcome, his future. Thinking about Thom was too
wrenching and I decided to compartmentalize everything and place Thom
elsewhere in my thoughts. I started to think about, instead, what movie Ryan
Vaughn and I would see the following afternoon and was mildly surprised
that I could actually look forward to something besides what I was going to
be doing after school that day.
—
WHEN THE bells rang at three o’clock I was the first to leave class and went
directly to Stansbury, where I got into the Jaguar and waited for Robert
Mallory’s Porsche to appear, though I wasn’t entirely positive it would. And
when it cruised down the street roughly twenty minutes after school ended
for the day, quickly enlarging itself in my side-view mirror, I slid down as it
passed by. I immediately sat up and started the car and followed the Porsche
onto Valley Vista. On that Monday afternoon Robert made the left onto
Beverly Glen instead of continuing across Valley Vista to the 405, which
meant he was stopping at the house on Benedict Canyon. I kept my distance
as I followed two cars behind and then pulled over and parked six houses up
from where the Porsche turned into the driveway. Robert got out and pushed
open the gate with the WARNING: NO TRESPASSING sign hanging lopsidedly from
it and stood still for a moment, looking around as if he thought he was being
watched. On that particular stretch of Benedict Canyon a few vehicles were
parked along the sides of the road—the trucks of gardeners and pool cleaners
—but none that caught Robert’s interest, and then he got back in the car and
it disappeared from view. I waited. It took about fifteen minutes for the
Porsche to pull out of the driveway and back onto Benedict Canyon. I
continued to wait until a car passed and then I followed Robert until he
stopped at the light on Sunset Boulevard and then drove into Beverly Hills, as
Benedict Canyon turned into North Canon Drive, and I realized that he was
going to glide past Susan Reynolds’s house even though her car wasn’t in the
driveway, confirming—my heart beating fast—that she had definitely stayed
at Buckley that afternoon. What was Robert doing parked in front of the
house if he already knew this? The Porsche backed up and then moved
forward as if the driver was angling to get a better look at something, trying
to solve a problem that the house offered, hoping it would give him answers
to the questions he was asking.
I was parked at the end of the block watching as the car idled in front of
the Reynolds residence for about five minutes. And then I resumed following
Robert as he pulled away from the house, and I stayed at least a thousand feet
behind but I wasn’t worried about losing him, because he never varied from
his ultimate destination. Robert made a right onto Santa Monica Boulevard
and I trailed him until Century City loomed into view and then he made a left
onto Avenue of the Stars. I made the same left and followed him until he
made another left into the driveway of the Century Towers, where he pulled
up to the valet and hopped out the driver’s side, carrying a black duffel bag
and hurriedly walked into the tower closest to Pico.
—
ON THAT MONDAY in October I sat in the Jaguar longer than I usually did
parked across the street from the entrance of the Century Towers and had
finally decided to go home when I saw a car I recognized pull into the valet
and I watched it, slumped in the driver’s seat, barely cognizant of anything
but my own private thoughts, and then suddenly very aware of something
else—the switch from one state to another happened so fast it was electric.
A black Trans Am entered the driveway of the Century Towers and I
watched it brake in front of the valet and the tension within me kept rising
until my entire body felt pressurized. The valet opened the door of the Trans
Am and Ryan Vaughn got out of the car, still in his Buckley uniform and
letterman’s sweater, and he asked something of the valet, who gestured to the
building Robert Mallory had entered thirty minutes previously. I stared out
the windshield; the passing rush of traffic coming up from Pico and flowing
down from Santa Monica Boulevard flashed by, jump-cutting my image of
Ryan as he walked into the tower. I was frozen. I was literally so cold with
the shock of seeing Ryan that I started trembling, even though I wasn’t sure
what I’d actually seen or what any of this meant. What had I missed? What
hadn’t I been paying attention to? Why hadn’t I noticed that Robert and Ryan
had become friends? And what made it so much worse was that I knew how
attractive Ryan found Robert Mallory. Regardless of Robert’s heterosexuality
and his love for Susan Reynolds, Ryan had admitted the weekend he’d spent
in the house on Mulholland that he wanted Robert to suck his cock and that
he wanted to get Robert on all fours and fuck him—Ryan told me this in the
Jacuzzi while we fantasized out loud about the new student and what we’d do
to him sexually if we could, if he would ever let us, or later on, as the fantasy
got more heated, if we forced him to. I felt as if I was being crushed. Panic
started consuming everything. I realized I needed to go to the bathroom and I
quickly pulled away from the curb.
And as I made a wide U-turn across Avenue of the Stars I noticed in the
rearview mirror another familiar vehicle, which I couldn’t quite place at first
and then in a rush I did.
It was the beige-colored van that followed me through Palm Springs on
Saturday night.
I don’t know how I placed it so quickly but it was slowly gliding by the
entrance of the Century Towers and I kept staring at it in the rearview mirror
until I almost rolled through a red light and had to brake to a sudden stop,
lurching forward. I watched as the beige-colored van flashed its lights twice
—as if it had confirmed that it had seen me though I could have completely
imagined that—and then made a U-turn and headed in the opposite direction
back toward Pico Boulevard.
—
ROSA WAS ALREADY GONE when I arrived at the empty house on
Mulholland. I didn’t linger in the car after I closed the garage, as I sometimes
did. I went straight to my bathroom, where I tried to pee but couldn’t—I was
too wired with tension and unable to relax and let the urine stream out. I
smoked three bowls of weed and relaxed enough so I could finally urinate.
The jealousy that inflamed me was lightly minimized by the weed, and the
half of the Quaalude I took sent me into the fuzzy realm of simply not caring
—“SNC,” I imagined emblazoned on a tight T-shirt that Susan Reynolds
wore—and soon I was high enough to walk into the kitchen and look through
the fridge to see what Rosa left for dinner. But I wasn’t hungry and simply
started to look through the Los Angeles Times folded on the island in the
kitchen, searching for traces of the Trawler and new info about Audrey
Barbour. I stopped when I realized that if I found anything it would alter the
high and potentially interrupt the calmness I finally felt, which made me
forget about Ryan Vaughn and Robert Mallory and everything else except my
own inner peace.
I floated back to my room and sat down at the desk and lifted books out
of the Gucci backpack and then I stopped and leaned over and opened the
bottom drawer and stared at the cassette I had listened to yesterday, placed
next to the pair of jockey shorts I’d taken from the house on Haskell. The
Santa Anas had picked up that night and it was the only noise I heard: the
wind crashing over the canyons and swirling outside the empty house,
booming against the windows. But when I picked up my European-history
textbook the winds had died down and I heard another sound—or thought I
had. It was the chime of the garage door opening, announcing itself
throughout the house, and I froze. If it hadn’t been for the Quaalude flowing
through me I wouldn’t have been able to stand and move slowly toward the
hallway that would take me into the rest of the house. I would have hidden in
the bathroom and locked the door.
I went to the kitchen and opened a drawer and calmly pulled out a
butcher knife and then made my way to the door that led to the garage. I
opened it and the lights above the cars automatically flickered on. The garage
door, I noticed, was halfway open, banging lightly in the winds that were
gusting across Mulholland. I just stood in the doorway and stared, trying to
remember if I had fully closed the garage with the remote or if I’d been too
distracted because I had to use the bathroom. I walked through the garage and
passed between the three cars parked in a row: the Jaguar, the 450SL and the
larger sedan. Everything looked as if it was in place. Nothing had been
rearranged. No poster had been left for me. There was no intruder waiting,
crouched below the cabinets. I placed my hand on a panel and pressed it with
my fingertip and the garage door slowly lowered until it was fully shut. I
waited a beat and then turned and stepped back into the silent hallway. Either
I hadn’t fully closed it or the wind had activated some mechanism that
opened the garage. I didn’t know. Or was it something else? I pushed the
thought away because what other reason could there have been?
You’re hearing things that aren’t there.
But I wasn’t sure about that anymore, I told the writer.
Maybe we’ve moved into another realm, I told the writer.
Still clutching the knife, I walked slowly into the living room, calmed by
the drugs, and headed trancelike toward the other side of the house, toward
my mother’s bedroom. I stood in the doorway and turned on the light and it
didn’t seem as if anything had been rearranged—everything was neat and
untouched. I told myself, again, that I was imagining things. I was hearing
something that wasn’t there. Don’t be such a pussy. And yet the sight of
Ryan Vaughn entering the Century Towers and the beige-colored van gliding
across Avenue of the Stars were real—they materialized and had happened. I
saw it—I was a witness. And then the colliding thoughts stopped because I
realized something was missing. I moved back into the kitchen and slowly
scanned the space.
“Shingy?” I said and waited. “Shingy?”
—
THERE WAS NOTHING: no barking, no excited whimpering, no
scrambling of paws clicking along the kitchen floor—just silence. His food
dish was full, as was the bowl of water next to it. I walked back to my
bedroom, moving slowly down the hall, clutching the butcher knife. I
scanned the space—like my mother’s room it looked neat, nothing was out of
place, nothing had been rearranged, it was clean, almost untouched. But
Shingy wasn’t under my desk or lying at the foot of the bed. I opened the
door that led out to the deck and tentatively walked across it as the wind
blasted through the trees in the backyard. I was still wearing my Buckley
uniform and the striped tie blew into my face when I called Shingy’s name
again, straining my voice over the sound of the wind, and waited. I lowered
the knife to my side and stood on the deck shivering. The backyard was
brightly lit and the lawn was a shiny dark green and the pool was a glowing
blue rectangle, the water rippling in the wind, the sudden black drop onto the
cliff side cutting a straight line between the light of the yard and the darkness
of the canyon that lay beyond it. I called the dog’s name again and moved
closer to the edge of the cliff, the eucalyptus trees above me thrashing in the
wind. There was a full yellow moon hanging over the lit blanket of the
valley, which seemed a hundred miles away that night, and reminded me how
alone I really was and always would be. I called the dog’s name again—I
actually yelled it, my hands cupped around my mouth: “Shingy!”
I waited.
In a break in the Santa Anas I heard something rustling through the brush
on the hillside and the sound made me instinctively back away to the deck,
but when Shingy emerged from the darkness of the canyon he saw who had
been calling his name and barked excitedly. Relief flooded through me as the
dog attempted to race across the lawn to where I stood but Shingy was
limping and I saw something wrong with his right front paw. I knelt down as
he jumped around me, whimpering, and I tried to get him on his side so I
could inspect the leg. It was lightly wet with blood and when I tried to push
the hair back to see the wound Shingy growled and snapped at me and then
stood and limped to the kitchen door. I walked across the lawn and opened
the door and he limped toward the food waiting for him. I watched as he ate
quickly and then settled into his pillow and started licking the injured paw. I
knelt down and tried to move his mouth away from where his tongue stroked
the wound but he growled, warning me, baring his upper teeth. It didn’t look
so bad in the light of the kitchen and I stood up and placed the butcher knife
back in the drawer and floated to my room.
Nothing else happened that night after I took the other half of the
Quaalude. I finished my homework in a peaceful daze and kept the TV on for
company and when the phone in my room rang at eleven and then at
midnight and then at one o’clock and I picked it up all three times the
Quaalude minimized any thoughts that might have occurred to me about the
half-opened garage, and the injury Shingy suffered, the question that I might
be a target and the fact that no one said anything each time I answered the
phone in the middle of the night.
22
I DECIDED on the five o’clock showing of Chariots of Fire at the Bruin in
Westwood as the movie Ryan and I would see on that Tuesday in October,
and when I suggested this Ryan agreed and said cool. We were by the lockers
after Mr. Robbins’s class and he seemed completely open in the moment—
his clear blue eyes alert and homing in on me, the smile natural, his whole
vibe looser than usual—and I realized he was no longer uncomfortable in the
way he had been: we were just friends now and he didn’t feel the pressure of
my desire anymore. I didn’t ask Ryan Vaughn where he had gone the
previous afternoon—if he was hanging out with Robert Mallory—or mention
that I had seen him in Century City: there was no way to ask about this
without looking like a freak. If I told him I knew about this I was certain it
would ruin everything and any hope of getting closer to Ryan would be lost.
Ryan betrayed nothing and just exhibited his usual low-key swagger and
mentioned that it was a movie about runners, right? Yeah, I said, and stopped
myself from adding: there are supposedly a few hot guys in it. The plan
sounded fine to him and he suggested maybe dinner after the movie at
Hamburger Hamlet, next to the Bruin. We’d have to meet in front of the
theater at four-forty-five, since he’d be coming from school. There were no
games scheduled that week, because of the bye week when Thom Wright was
away, but Coach Holtz expected Ryan at practice that afternoon, only an
hour, and he could easily make it to Westwood by the time the movie started.
I was looking at Susan Reynolds and Robert Mallory talking to each other on
a walkway beneath the eaves when Ryan said this and then I was staring back
at his face, and noticed that he’d glanced at them as well, and in that moment
I realized I didn’t trust him anymore, if I ever really had, and that there was
nothing to save, things were already ruined, there was nothing to hope for.
But I just smiled and said I was looking forward to the movie.
—
I WAITED UNDER the giant curved blue neon Deco marquee of the Bruin
as the chilly sky over Westwood darkened, holding my ticket, constantly
checking my watch, nervous. I paced across the terrazzo floor leading into
the lobby, quiet at five o’clock, and watched as a few people bought tickets
and two guys in UCLA sweatshirts were the only ones at the concession
stand. I looked at the posters encased in glass for movies opening later that
fall—Ragtime, Venom, Absence of Malice—and lingered in front of them.
Ryan was walking down Broxton in the fading light and smiled when he saw
me standing beneath the marquee.
“Hey,” he said at the ticket booth, reaching for his wallet and quickly
making the What’s up? face at me.
“Hey,” I said, nodding, smiling, hands in my pockets.
He had showered and his hair was brushed back and he was wearing
jeans, and a blue Lacoste to match his eyes and a Members Only jacket, and
he smiled at me once again as we walked to the lobby, handed our tickets to
an usher and then headed to the concession stand.
“You getting anything?” he asked.
“I’m okay,” I said and watched as he bought a small carton of Milk
Duds.
The soundtrack from Chariots of Fire was playing throughout the semideserted auditorium, and I let Ryan choose the seats, which were in the
middle of the theater and farther back than I would have sat, and he preferred
the center of the row, though I liked the aisle. The lights dimmed and the
curtain lifted and the already famous Vangelis score began and I was vaguely
paying attention to young runners sprinting along the water’s edge of a
cloudy beach in slow motion—the music was supposed to stir us but I
immediately located a sadness in the score that was quickly killing me and I
started tearing up but clenched myself so tightly that the moment passed.
I thought Ryan might have snickered at this opening sequence, lean in
and say something dirty, comment on the runners, but he didn’t. He was quiet
and kept concentrating on the screen as the story unfolded, every so often
lifting a Milk Dud to his mouth and chewing contemplatively. I knew who
the cinematographer David Watkin was and I thought the movie looked good
but I didn’t find any of the British guys attractive even though they were
young college athletes because, I suppose, I was distracted by sitting so
closely to Ryan, and I became self-conscious about any movement I might
make. I wanted to touch him, rub my fingers along the edge of his zipper,
pull his cock out and jack him off, just so I could watch his face during
orgasm and smell his semen, and I grew instantly hard thinking about this.
Chariots of Fire wasn’t my kind of movie (there was no action or violence or
sex or nudity—it was resolutely PG) and I deflated a little when I realized it
was going to include a lecture about anti-Semitism. My increasing boredom
and the closeness to Ryan was maddening: the movie was so well intentioned
and noble that by a certain point I didn’t even know what was going on. I
wanted to touch Ryan’s cock. I wanted to kiss his mouth. I wanted to run my
finger between the crevice of his ass. I had to refrain from glancing over at
him and when I finally did he was staring intently up at the screen,
occasionally chewing on a Milk Dud, his jaw clenching and unclenching,
seemingly lost in the movie. At one point he noticed me looking at him and
offered the yellow carton, thinking that’s what I wanted, and I shook my head
no. I began to assume that Ryan was more immersed in the movie than me
because it was about athletes—it was basically a simple sports movie, I
realized, and it was about the camaraderie of men: men watching each other,
men sizing each other up, men admiring each other because of their physical
accomplishments—and it also had a religious element. One of the runners
was racing for God, which Ryan either responded to or rejected—I didn’t
know. “Run in God’s name,” someone said, and I wondered if this stirred
something in him.
Suddenly Ryan got up without saying anything and walked away from
me down the row to the aisle on the other side of the theater. I turned my
head and watched as he exited the auditorium. He was gone for only a few
minutes and then he came back and took his seat. “What did I miss?” he
asked, leaning in. I could smell the soap that he had washed his hands with—
he had used the restroom, I realized. “Um, he can’t run on the Sabbath,” I
explained. Ryan nodded and looked back at the screen. The movie ended
with an anticlimactic race in slow motion I wasn’t prepared for, and then it
was over. Ryan stood up as the credits played and stretched exaggeratedly to
loosen up and then I followed him into the lobby. I had to use the restroom
and Ryan told me he’d be outside. I walked up the stairs to the men’s room
and stood at the urinal thinking about how to approach the rest of the night. If
everything was lost, then why not throw in a grenade: tell Ryan that you
loved him and just let everything blow up. What difference did it make if
nothing was going to happen? I zipped my jeans and washed my hands and
proceeded back to the lobby, where I noticed Ryan was standing on the
terrazzo floor beneath the marquee, staring at the poster for Venom—the
word in bright-yellow letters and shaped like fangs next to a drawing of a
snake slithering out of a vent. “You liked the movie?” he asked. We started
walking next door to Hamburger Hamlet. “Yeah, it was okay,” I said. He
nodded, a simple affirmation.
We were on Weyburn when he casually said, “Do you care if Robert
joins us?” I had no idea what he was talking about at first, and even though
I’d been thinking about the two of them together for the past twenty-four
hours it still didn’t register who he was referencing. “What?” I asked, turning
to him as we moved along the sidewalk.
“Do you care if Robert comes to dinner?” Ryan asked. “He’s joining us.”
I stopped walking. He turned and looked at me, quizzically, his brow
furrowed, wondering why I’d stopped.
“What are you doing?” I asked.
“What do you mean?” he asked back blankly.
“Why are you inviting Robert to join us?” I asked.
“I thought you wouldn’t mind,” he said, confused. “Is something
wrong?”
“I thought it was just going to be us,” I said.
“What’s the difference?” he asked, still confused, and then, “Did you
want to hold hands?”
I was stifled with embarrassment when Ryan said this.
“Do you have a problem?” Ryan asked. “With Robert?”
“He’s crazy,” I said quietly. “And you’ve got to be crazy hanging out
with him.”
“What are you talking about?” he asked. “How is he crazy?”
“He had a breakdown at Susan’s party—” I started.
“A breakdown?” Ryan interrupted. “What does that mean?”
“He went fucking nuts. He had this meltdown. He’s on a bunch of
different drugs. He’s on fucking Thorazine—” I was saying this all in a low
rush.
“I don’t know what that is—” Ryan interrupted again, confused.
“He was in a mental institution,” I said quietly. “A fucking mental
institution. In Illinois. Just this past year. He’s sick. There’s something wrong
with him, there’s—”
“I think you need to take it easy—” Ryan said, speaking over me.
“You shouldn’t be hanging out with him, Ryan—”
“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” he said, holding up a hand. “Who said
I’m hanging out with him?”
I stared straight at his face. “You’re not hanging out with him? Is that
what you’re saying? You’re saying you’re not hanging out with Robert
Mallory?” This was leveled at Ryan as an accusation.
Ryan looked back at me, annoyed and impatient. “Why would you care
if I was hanging out with Robert?” he asked. “I’m not saying I have but even
if I was what’s the big deal?”
“Are you?” I asked, accusingly. “Have you been?”
Ryan just stared, unsure as to where he should steer the conversation.
“Maybe,” he said. The evasive way he uttered this infuriated me,
especially when I knew that Ryan desired Robert.
“You know, he’s not gay,” I said. “He’s not going to have sex with you,
if that’s what you’re hoping. He’s in love with Susan Reynolds. He’s not
going to have sex with you.”
Ryan stared at me for a beat as if he was trying to figure everything out,
and then he looked away and down Weyburn, his eyes fixed on the streets
curving up toward UCLA beyond the sign for the Westworld arcade. “Why
do you say shit like that?” he quietly asked. A young couple was passing by.
We just stood there, not moving out of their way. They walked around us.
“I don’t think you know the truth,” I said.
“I think that you are losing it,” he countered, carefully. “I mean, I just
want to have a good time.” He paused. “And you’re causing all of this drama
—”
“Ryan, he had something to do with Matt Kellner,” I said, my voice low
and controlled. “He had something to do with Matt’s death. He was with Matt
when he died. He contributed. He was a factor in Matt’s death—”
Ryan recoiled from me, his eyes wide, his mouth shaped into a grimace.
“What are you talking about?” he asked.
“Ryan, you’ve got to believe me,” I said. “He’s connected to the missing
girls. The Trawler. There’s something going on with him. And I know he had
something to do with Matt. There’s a tape. His voice is on it—”
Ryan was walking away from me and toward the entrance of the
restaurant. I hadn’t realized how frantic I’d become.
“Stop it, just fucking stop it,” I heard Ryan mutter.
“Ryan—” I reached out and grabbed his shoulder.
He whirled around. “What are you doing? What are you talking about?
Do you know how fucking crazy you sound?” He calmly checked his watch.
“He should be here any minute. Maybe you should go home. I don’t know.”
“When did you invite him?” I asked. “Did you invite him when we were
watching the movie—”
“I invited him at lunch,” Ryan said patiently. “I was going to tell you at
school but I didn’t see you the rest of the day.”
He was about to push open the door. I was staring at the Halloween
decorations adorning the windows of the Postermat and I was about to tell
Ryan to fuck it, that I’d be heading home and that I’d see him tomorrow at
Buckley, when I suddenly noticed a vehicle slowly approaching in the
distance, crossing Westwood Boulevard and gliding along Weyburn. It was a
beige-colored van. And I was struck mute as the van drove past us, my eyes
trailing it. I turned and watched as the van cruised past Hamburger Hamlet
and then Broxton and toward Gayley, where it waited until the light turned
green and made a left. I couldn’t tell if it was the same van I’d seen in Palm
Springs on Saturday night or the one I glimpsed in Century City yesterday
afternoon, flashing its lights at me before making that wide U-turn on Avenue
of the Stars. All I knew was that it rendered me helpless and I shut down. I
turned to Ryan, who stood at the entrance of the restaurant, his hand on the
door, waiting. I must have suddenly looked different—scared, pale,
dumbstruck—because Ryan’s expression became concerned. “Are you
okay?” he asked. “What just happened?” I touched my forehead—I could feel
my fingers trembling. “I just…I just need to sit down…” In a daze I moved
past Ryan and walked into the restaurant. “Bret?” I heard him say as he
followed me in. “Bret? Are you okay?”
—
I MUTTERED that I had to go to the restroom and jogged up the staircase
adjacent to the entrance and fell against the men’s-room door, clutching and
unclutching my fists while taking in a number of deep and steady breaths: I
had never experienced this level of fear and panic before and nothing
prepared me for how deep and overwhelming it was. I splashed cold water on
my face and wiped it off with a paper towel. I stared at myself in the mirror. I
regained some kind of composure and made my way back downstairs—I’d be
telling Ryan that I wasn’t feeling well and needed to get home. But Ryan and
Robert were already sitting across from each other in one of the red booths in
the front room, at a window table overlooking Weyburn, and they both
glanced up from their oversized menus as I neared them. I had no idea what
Ryan had told Robert, but I suspected nothing about what I’d said earlier on
the sidewalk, because Robert raised his eyes and smiled innocently at me as I
decided to slide into the booth. I realized I wasn’t going to let Ryan sit alone
with Robert for any amount of time if I could help it and so I erased the fake
excuse and sat down next to Ryan and across from Robert.
Ryan was giving a rundown of what he thought about Chariots of Fire
and I was supposing Ryan was under Robert’s spell and trying to sound more
sophisticated than he actually was, but Robert wasn’t gay, so why was Ryan
trying to impress him? Then I realized Ryan wasn’t gay either, so none of this
mattered in the manufactured dream we existed in. But I decided to be real
and started interrupting Ryan and criticized the movie and the things I didn’t
like about it—it was boring, it was anticlimactic, there was no excitement, I
made fun of the religious element. This was a performance and it took a
physical commitment that was exhausting, but I maintained it. Robert
responded to my harsh assessment with occasional laughter while Ryan kept
jokingly trying to defend the movie and I was okay for a while—we briefly
talked about Terry Schaffer’s party on Saturday, Ryan wasn’t going, Robert
and I were—but after we ordered, things quickly fell apart. Robert mentioned
it was his eighteenth birthday in two weeks and invited both of us to the
dinner he was planning. It was going to be at a restaurant called Le Dome, he
said, and it would be just Thom and Susan, Debbie and myself, Jeff and
Tracy and Ryan. When Robert said that Susan Reynolds had suggested the
restaurant, my rage returned and I immediately allowed the paranoid anger to
envelop me.
“Is Susan throwing the birthday dinner for you?” I asked, pretending to
be curious.
“No,” Robert said. “I’m taking everyone out—actually my aunt is
paying. Susan just suggested the restaurant.”
“When did she suggest this?” I asked.
“I think, um, last week,” Robert said.
He sat back as the waitress placed our drink orders down—everyone had
a Coke.
“Not while you guys were in Palm Springs?” I asked.
“No,” Robert said without missing a beat. “We didn’t see each other in
Palm Springs.” This was said so effortlessly I had to nod, impressed.
“Okay, okay,” I said.
“I was just asking her what some cool places were,” Robert said. “And
she mentioned Le Dome.”
“It’s pretty fancy,” I said. “Are you sure you don’t want to go
somewhere more casual?”
“I don’t know what Le Dome is,” Ryan admitted.
“It’s a place on Sunset, a block from Tower Records,” I said not looking
at him, just staring at Robert.
“My aunt took me the other night,” Robert said. “It’s cool. It’s pretty
good. I don’t think it’s too fancy. My aunt’s paying.”
There wasn’t any trace of animosity in the conversation and to someone
overhearing us it probably sounded innocuous, despite my growing rage,
because I was trying to keep it together by treating this as a game—it wasn’t
real, it could never be real, because everyone was hiding something,
everyone was a liar. Ryan was trying not to eye me warily because of what I
had admitted outside (Robert was in love with Susan Reynolds, Robert was
involved with Matt Kellner’s death, Robert was connected to the Trawler)
and kept steering the conversation back to Chariots of Fire and then asked
what movies Robert had seen recently—an attempt to steer the conversation
into legitimately innocuous territory, because I knew Ryan Vaughn didn’t
care and wasn’t particularly invested in movies. Robert admitted he hadn’t
seen any films lately.
“Why not?” I asked suddenly.
“Because, I guess, I’ve been busy,” he said, his eyes darting from me to
Ryan.
“Busy with what?” I asked.
“School, homework, studying,” Robert said.
“And going to Palm Springs,” I reminded him.
“I’ve been out a couple times.” He shrugged, sipped his Coke.
“Who do you stay with out there?” I asked.
“A friend of the family’s,” he said, unfazed. “In Rancho Mirage.”
“So you never saw any movies with Matt?” I asked softly.
“What?” Robert asked.
“Did you and Matt ever go to the movies?”
“Matt?” he asked. “No.” Pause. “I didn’t really know Matt.”
“Don’t bring Matt up,” Ryan said quietly. “Come on, Bret.”
“Why not?” I asked. “Matt and Robert were friends. They hung out.”
“Not really,” Robert said. “I mean I tried to get to know him but—”
“What happened?” I asked too quickly. “You tried? How?”
“Well, you knew him,” Robert said, hesitantly. “You know how hard it
could be to reach him.”
“Reach him?” I murmured, nodding. “Yeah, I guess.” I paused. “How
hard did you try?” I paused again. “I mean, to reach him.”
“Well, we’d eat lunch together sometimes,” he said. “We talked at
school—”
“Did you ever go over to his house?” I asked. “On Haskell Avenue?”
“No,” Robert said.
“Did he ever come over to yours?” I asked.
“No.”
“So you didn’t really try that hard to reach him.”
Robert stared at me. I’d finally activated the whirring behind the eyes,
even though a smile was frozen on his face.
“Are you accusing me of something?” he asked lightly, containing
himself. “What’s going on?”
“No, no,” I said, acting completely complacent. “I’m sorry if it came off
like that. I’m just, I guess, interested, considering, you know, what
happened…”
“Right, right,” Robert said, nodding. “I understand.”
“So you didn’t really hang out with him?” I asked.
“Bret,” Robert said, sighing. “I talked to Ronald Kellner. If you want to
know what I said to him, you can just call him yourself.”
“It’s funny, because Ronald said Matt was going to see you before he
disappeared,” I said. “I’ve already talked to Ronald, by the way.”
Ryan glanced at me, and then over to Robert, utterly confused.
“Yeah, supposedly Matt said this…” Robert confirmed. “And we had
vague plans. I’d given Matt my number and he was supposed to call me—”
“Which number?” I interrupted.
“My number,” Robert said. “Not the one in the roster.” A beat. “It’s
private.”
“So—you never saw Matt Kellner the week he disappeared?” I asked.
“Bret,” Ryan said. I ignored him.
“What do you mean?” Robert squinted at me, confused. “See him?”
“I mean did he ever stop by your place?” I asked. “Did you guys talk?
Did he ever call you the week he was missing? Or make any kind of
contact?”
“No, we hadn’t talked, and no, he didn’t make any kind of contact with
me.” Robert sat very still in the booth, his eyes whirring, trying to figure out
how to play this game and combat me.
“You guys didn’t drive out to Crystal Cove together?” I asked gently.
“You guys didn’t record some tapes together?”
“Bret,” Ryan warned again.
“What are you talking about?” Robert asked back. “Tapes? I’ve never
been to Crystal Cove.”
“I’m just asking,” I said soothingly.
Robert’s gaze hardened. “Whatever was going on between you and Matt
is none of my business.” He paused. “I understand,” he said, “that it was hard
for you.” He paused again. “Considering, y’know, the nature of your
friendship.” He realized how this sounded and then clarified: “Whatever that
was.”
I was too shocked to say anything but since Ryan already knew about
Matt and me it didn’t really explode.
“But I didn’t know Matt,” Robert said. “So I don’t know what you’re
asking me.”
“How do you know what was going on between Matt and me?” I asked
in defensive mode. “Did Matt tell you? Did he actually tell you?”
“No,” Robert said. “He just told me you had a falling out and that the
two of you weren’t hanging anymore.” He paused. “I asked what the falling
out was about but he was kind of vague.” He paused again, offered a little
shrug. “I assumed it was something that was none of my business.”
“Why would you assume that?” I asked. “Why would it be none of your
business?”
“Susan mentioned something,” Robert said. “That you guys were…
close.”
I wanted to scream. I wanted to leap out of the booth. Instead, I just
stared at Robert, paralyzed. But I was also on the verge of collapsing and
crawling away from the table to find a corner to cover my face with my hands
and cower in.
“And you thought what?” I asked. “You believed her?”
“Yeah, sure,” Robert said. “Why shouldn’t I believe her?”
And then I couldn’t stop myself: it rushed out of me.
“Well, Susan mentioned to me that you’d been institutionalized part of
your junior year before you came to Buckley.” I paused. “Should I believe
that?”
Robert flinched, then turned away. Ryan was looking back and forth
between the two of us, again utterly confused at where we had taken the
conversation. Robert didn’t prolong the moment and turned back to me with a
wary expression.
“Yeah, um, I was dealing…with some stuff,” Robert admitted, sighing.
“Yeah, I, um, was in a place outside of Jacksonville for a couple months.” He
paused. “And I was figuring things out.” He stopped. “My father placed me
there. I didn’t think I needed to go.”
“But you told us you were in Roycemore,” I said quietly. “When you
first came to Buckley you said you were in Roycemore. You never mentioned
anything about a mental institution—”
“It wasn’t a mental institution,” Robert said. “It was a…facility.” He
made a gesture with his hand. “And what? Come on. I’m just supposed to
blurt that out? My first day of school? When I just met you guys?”
“I don’t know,” I said, shaking my head. “I just don’t know…”
“You don’t know what?” he asked.
“I don’t know if you’re fucking crazy or not,” I said.
Silence. The three of us just stared at each other.
And then I started laughing, trying to pass the whole thing off as a joke.
And it worked, because Ryan took my cue and started to laugh as well,
whether he wanted to or not, which caused Robert to uneasily smile and nod.
“Hey, I’m sorry, I’m just fucking around,” I said, reaching across the table
and grabbing his wrist. “You cool?”
Ryan and Robert realized that we had been unwittingly playing some
kind of game I’d created that teetered on the edge of cruelty and that this had
all been an elaborate joke. Dinner arrived and within the returning pantomime
everything was smooth and easygoing. Part of the tension had broken and
everyone was relieved that the conversation about Matt was over, but, if I
look back, only part of the tension had cracked, because Robert never told us
why he was in the facility in Jacksonville and I didn’t press it and I also
didn’t tell Robert I knew about Susan Reynolds, that Robert had lied about
being in Palm Springs with her, and that I had followed him to an abandoned
house on Benedict Canyon on a number of afternoons that fall and that I
didn’t believe him about Matt Kellner because I had in my possession a tape
that was made the last night Matt was alive and the pretend voice taunting
Matt had come from the mouth of the boy sitting across from me in the red
leather booth at Hamburger Hamlet and the tape was left in my mailbox by
him sometime before he’d headed off to Palm Springs that weekend and that
I found Sunday morning.
But I didn’t have to wait long to find out exactly why Robert Mallory
was placed in that developmental center outside of Jacksonville during the
second half of his junior year in the spring of 1981. I found out the next day.
23
ON WEDNESDAY MORNING ROSA MENTIONED that a message on my
mother’s answering machine had been left for me. It was eight-forty and I’d
just walked into the kitchen in my school uniform and tossed the Gucci
backpack onto the island while I opened the refrigerator and swigged from a
carton of orange juice. I avoided the copy of the Los Angeles Times waiting
for me next to a bowl of berries Rosa had laid out, afraid of what might be in
it, and walked through the house to my mom’s room, where I sat on the bed
and pressed PLAY on the answering machine. I waited. And then I heard a
woman’s voice I didn’t recognize. “Bret, I hope this is the right number,
though I suppose you might have your own…number, but this is the only one
in the roster.” I leaned toward the machine. I was apprehensive. I
automatically thought I was in some kind of trouble. But then the hesitant
voice said, “This is Abby Mallory, I’m Robert’s aunt, we talked on the phone
I think on Friday, when you called and I told you Robert was in Palm
Springs. I think you went out with him and Ryan last night?” She asked this
as a question even though it wasn’t—she knew and also apparently knew
Ryan Vaughn well enough to refer to him by his first name.
“Anyway, Robert already left for school this morning and…” She
stopped. I wasn’t breathing. “He told me some things that you, um, said to
him last night and I think that maybe you…and I should talk.” She paused
again as if weighted down by what she wanted to tell me. “I don’t want him
to know that I called you and I don’t want to do this over the phone, so if you
could meet me somewhere I would appreciate it.” She paused. “I think there
are things you need to know.” My stomach dropped and I found myself
gripping the comforter on my mother’s bed. She paused again. “There is…
something…that I think needs to be clarified for you…about Robert.” There
was another pause. “I hope you get this message and you call me back.” I
thought she was about to hang up but then she left a number, which I
scrawled down on the pad by the phone on my mother’s nightstand. Abigail
Mallory ended the message with “Sooner is better. I could meet this
afternoon. I’ll be in Beverly Hills at my lawyer’s office and I could meet
afterward, around five, when you’re out of school. I hope you get this before
you head to Buckley. If you call back don’t leave a message. If I don’t hear
from you I’ll try again.” She paused. “And please, please, don’t tell Robert I
called.” There was an abrupt click.
I sat still on my mother’s bed only a moment before I reached for the
phone. Abigail answered immediately and after a brief conversation she
asked me to meet her at La Scala Boutique at five o’clock.
—
I PULLED the 450SL into the half-filled parking lot adjacent to La Scala
Boutique and easily found a space. I walked the short distance to the entrance
still wearing my school uniform and took off my Wayfarers as I opened the
door. The restaurant, which sat on the corner of Beverly Drive and Little
Santa Monica Boulevard, was ringed with booths and there were a number of
tables tightly packed together in the middle of the space and a small bar that
sat six was in the corner, decorated with hanging Chianti bottles. At the booth
before the entrance to the kitchen sat a woman dressed in a cream-colored
blouse and a black blazer, wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette, which
she stubbed out in an ashtray next to a glass of white wine—she was the only
person in the entire restaurant. “I didn’t know if you were coming or not,”
Abigail said as she took off her sunglasses and I neared the table. She was
younger than I expected, probably early thirties, and then I remembered she
wasn’t Robert’s mother—she was the younger sister of his father, and she
was striking in ways similar to Robert and I was suddenly curious as to what
his father looked like, if he was as handsome and sexually alluring as his son.
I sat down across from her and realized I didn’t need to say my name. “Do
you want a drink?” she asked quietly. I shook my head.
“I’m sorry if I’m a little off,” she started. “I just came from a meeting
with my attorney,” she explained. “My husband and I are in the middle of a
rather protracted divorce. And he is being fairly difficult. Though I know he
says the same thing about me.” She paused and added a sad little smile. “And
these appointments have become very unpleasant.” She lifted the glass and
finished the wine. “I should have probably rescheduled this. I’m sorry.” She
was so reserved it was like sitting with an actress straining to play a part in a
scene she hadn’t remembered the lines to.
I didn’t know what I was supposed to say as a seventeen-year-old
costumed in a private-school uniform, so I just stared at her and quietly
nodded as if I understood. I didn’t have anything to say, because I didn’t
know where to begin, and I also realized, sitting in the booth at La Scala, that
I didn’t want to know anything and that maybe I should just leave and let
everything play out without knowing why Robert’s aunt thought it was so
important to meet, especially with the added caveat that I’d been warned
Robert should never know about this meeting or the phone call that set it up.
She was studying me without expression as if trying to neutrally figure out
who this boy was she had summoned to meet her and if she could trust him. I
finally looked away and down at the table and waited until she said
something. The maître d’, who I recognized from my frequent visits to the
restaurant with my parents, walked out of the kitchen wearing slacks and a
Polo shirt, and asked her if she’d like another glass of wine, and Abby
nodded without saying anything. I watched as he went to the bar and came
back with a half-empty bottle of chilled Pinot Grigio and poured it until her
glass was filled to the brim. Abby nodded thanks and the maître d’ asked me
if I’d like a drink. I just shook my head and murmured no.
“Robert told me he saw you last night,” she finally said.
“Yeah, Ryan invited him to dinner after we went to the movies,” I said.
“In Westwood,” I uselessly added.
“Robert told me you were…upset, it seemed.” She paused and waited for
me to say something.
“No, not really,” I lied. “I wasn’t upset. We were—I mean, I was kind of
joking around,” I said. “I was joking around. Whatever I said wasn’t meant to
be taken so seriously.”
“Robert said that you said that but that’s not what Robert thought…” She
took a sip of wine. “He didn’t believe you when you said you were just
joking.”
I didn’t say anything at first. A vague annoyance was rising within me
that I tried to tamp down. “Well, I can’t help it if he couldn’t take a joke.”
She considered this and took another sip of wine. “He said that you, well,
went after him last night. He said that you seemed to be accusing him of
something that he said he has nothing to do with and knows nothing about.” I
felt a chill when I heard this but Abigail said it in a calm voice—she wasn’t
accosting me. She was just relating the facts that Robert had supplied her
with. The Valium, as usual, was steadying me and I was able to stare at her
without breaking down over Matt Kellner and the terrible things I imagined
Robert had done to him.
“But I said I was joking. I said it was a game. It was a guy thing, y’know,
just screwing around, testing limits, being a dick. I mean everything seemed
fine afterward.” I paused. I was lying and I didn’t care and I flashed on how I
had sobbed on the drive back from Westwood to the empty house on
Mulholland, and now in La Scala I became emboldened. “What did Robert
take so seriously that he had to tell you about it?” This was a dare on my part
and the first moment in the conversation when I felt like an adult—that I had
risen to the occasion and was defending myself from whatever her fucked-up
nephew had accused me of. Abigail was still studying me and didn’t answer
my question. Instead, she went in a different direction. She wasn’t evasive
but genuinely curious.
“Robert has mentioned you a lot,” she said. “In fact since the first day of
school.” She was staring at me but there was no anger, she wasn’t
admonishing, she was just telling me things. “He said you saw him
somewhere, at a movie, over a year ago.” She paused. “A movie that he told
you he wasn’t at. And you didn’t believe him.” She sipped the wine. “And
later that day you followed him.” She paused again. “After school.”
“No, I didn’t follow him,” I said calmly. “I was driving to the Galleria
and he started following me. And he followed me into the Galleria. I wasn’t
following anybody.”
She just stared at me as if she was deciding whether she could believe
me or not.
“He doesn’t know you’re here, right?” Her expression and her voice
became concerned. “You didn’t mention anything about meeting me here,
right?”
“No, no, he doesn’t,” I said quietly. “You told me not to.” I paused and
then said, “I don’t really talk to Robert.” I paused again. “I don’t really trust
him.”
“He became very interested in you,” she said. “From the first day.” She
paused. “He talks about you a lot.” She sipped her wine. “He said that you…
unsettled him…when you told him you were positive you saw him at that
movie theater over a year ago.”
I felt another chill, a wave of apprehension. “Why…did that unsettle
him?” I asked. “I know he was there. I don’t know why he was lying about
it.”
“Don’t you know?” she asked. “Or are you pretending you don’t know
why?” She leaned in. “Look, we can sit here all day and evade whatever your
situation is, Bret—”
“What’s my situation?” I asked, and realized my voice sounded helpless
and reedy like a child. “Why does everyone need to be so careful around
Robert? And why do I need to believe what Robert says? I think he’s a
fucking liar—”
“I didn’t say that,” she said, surprised. “That’s not what I meant.”
“You’re implying that I’ve done something wrong,” I said. “That I’ve
said something wrong. When Robert is, I believe, a pretty screwed-up guy.
What’s my situation?”
She didn’t say anything. She kept studying me as if she couldn’t figure
out if I was trustworthy or not, someone who could act with her in this scene
she was creating as a confidant, a co-conspirator, another performer who
would get on her level. “Well, you told Robert last night that you thought he
was crazy.”
“Is he?” I asked. “Is he messed up? Is he dangerous? Why do I need to
be so careful around him?” I asked. “Why is he on Thorazine?” I asked.
“He’s not on Thorazine,” Abigail said, confused. “Robert’s not on
Thorazine,” she said again. “Who told you that?”
I stopped and retraced the days back to Susan’s party, where I heard her
utter this by the edge of the pool. “I think he…told someone this,” I said
quietly. “I think he told Susan Reynolds this.”
“No, he’s not on Thorazine,” she said, sipping the wine again. “He takes
a benzodiazepine but nothing heavier than that.” She furrowed her brow.
“Thorazine?”
“Look, I’m not sure what Robert is exactly capable of,” I said, trying to
carefully formulate how I wanted to relay this. “I think he is…or I’ve come to
believe that he is…a somewhat troubled…individual who is responsible
for…a number of things.” I said this without emotion, and it sounded hollow,
devoid of reason or fact, something bland and bureaucratic. Abigail was
silent. I looked around the empty room. The restaurant had a panoramic view
of Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive as well as Little Santa Monica
Boulevard, the streets backed up with rush-hour traffic. The sky was
darkening and it would soon be night. Suddenly I was scanning the streets for
a glimpse of the beige-colored van. In the ensuing silence I asked: “Why was
Robert in that…facility? The one outside of Jacksonville?” I paused. “What
happened?”
“How did you find out about that?” she asked, unsurprised but curious.
“Susan Reynolds told me,” I said.
“Susan,” she said, smiling to herself. “Do you know that I’ve never met
her?”
“Why…would you have met her?” I asked.
“Because Robert is quite taken with her,” Abigail said. “That’s why.”
“She has a boyfriend,” I automatically said. “And Thom’s my best
friend.”
“I know. I understand that,” she said. “It’s a delicate situation for
everyone, isn’t it?”
I didn’t want to talk about that. It was already playing out between
Robert and Susan. I knew what was going on and what would eventually
happen and I wanted to postpone the reality for as long as I possibly could.
Thom would be back in four days. “Why was Robert in that facility?” I asked
again.
“His father put him there,” she said simply.
“What did he do?” I asked. “What did Robert do so he had to be put in
whatever the fuck it is? A mental institution?”
“I wasn’t…there,” Abigail said vaguely. “I only…heard things.” She
paused. “Robert disputed them but a few things happened that alarmed his
father, supposedly.” She paused again. “As well as his stepmother.” She
sipped her wine. “And there was an incident with his stepsister that was, I am
supposing, the final straw. Though Robert denied it ever happened.”
“So he was only there once?” I asked. “He hadn’t been institutionalized
any times before that?”
“No,” she said and then carefully explained, “His mother’s death seemed
to be the catalyst for Robert going off the rails a bit, which is to be expected,
but I think he was hit exceptionally hard and it just exacerbated whatever else
was going on with Robert before her death.” She didn’t know how much
more she should offer and abruptly stopped. It was all tinged with vagueness
and in that moment I thought I preferred it that way, but I realized I didn’t: I
needed specifics.
“So his father put him in there,” I said, coaxing her. “And it was only
once.”
“It was about four and a half months,” Abigail said. “January until May.”
“Can you tell me what happened?” I asked gently.
“Well, I don’t know what exactly happened,” she said, and then, “What
did Robert tell you?”
“He told us his mother died, and that he didn’t get along with his father
or his stepmother and that he wanted to move to Los Angeles and live with
you, and that his dad ultimately agreed.” I paused and then asked as
delicately as possible: “What happened to his mother?”
“We don’t really know,” Abigail said matter-of-factly. “I didn’t know
my sister-in-law very well, but supposedly this was an accident. She had
fallen from the upstairs landing in her home, tripped over the banister, and
landed in such a way that she was killed instantly.” Abigail paused, sipped
the wine—the glass was now almost empty. She was completely unemotional
when she said this, though the wine had caused her face to flush. She looked
around for the maître d’ and then at the boy sitting across from her. “But
there were always questions—”
“Questions?” I interrupted her.
“Discrepancies,” she clarified, momentarily distracted. “There were
always questions on William’s part. It didn’t quite add up for him. She’d
have to be in a certain position by the banister, the railing, on the second
floor, William said…” She paused, debating if she should go on. “But, look,
it had been a contentious divorce and William, that’s Robert’s father, hated
Carol, he really hated her by then, and the case, which was never not referred
to as an accident despite the suggestive nature of William’s inquiries, was
simply closed and that was it. And then Robert moved in with William and
Diane, his stepmother, and Ashley, his younger stepsister from Diane’s
previous marriage, even though William wanted to send Robert away to a
boarding school, but it was already May—Carol died in April—and the plan
was to enroll Robert somewhere in September.” Abigail paused and then
decided to take another path. “Look, I wasn’t entirely correct about Carol’s
death being the only thing impacting Robert. Something was happening
before. There were things happening to Robert that were affecting him in
strange ways before her death. This was according to both Carol and
William. And I have to reiterate, Bret, I wasn’t there. I was living out here.
And I really only know what either William or Robert or Carol told me.” She
suddenly waved a hand through the air as if it signified something. “The
specifics aren’t important, it’s just differing versions of events, but there was
definitely a part of Robert that I became worried about, that concerned me—
there were drugs, there was acting out, he had threatened a classmate.” She
paused again and then realized something. “I guess I’m telling you this so
you would be more careful around him, because he’s very…sensitive.” I
realized that Abigail was buzzed and this was causing her to ramble. “And
that I’m not quite sure what you think he is capable of. I’m saying he’s not
the dangerous individual you seem to say he is—”
“Yes, you are,” I interrupted. “You’re afraid of him.”
She paused. “Well, I think you need to define what you mean by
dangerous—”
“Jesus Christ, what are you saying? Why am I fucking here? I don’t want
to know any of this shit. I don’t want you to tell me anything. You’re
basically telling me that Robert’s dad thinks Robert might have had
something to do with his mother’s death? Is that what I was supposed to take
away from that—”
“But you need to know these things,” she said quietly. “Because you
need to stop this feeling you have about Robert—”
“I changed my mind,” I said. “I’m afraid of this. I don’t want to know
anything else about this.”
“Maybe that’s a good thing,” she said, grasping. “Being afraid. Keeping
alert—”
“I’m sick of being afraid,” I said. “And you’re afraid, too. That’s why
you’re here. That’s why you called me. You’re scared.”
She shrugged. “You get used to it.”
“Oh, fuck this,” I muttered, and then, staring at her, I couldn’t help but
ask, “What do other people think happened to his mother? Do they think
Robert had something to do with it?”
“Of course not, Bret,” she said, looking around the restaurant for the
maître d’, her fingers lightly clenched around the stem of the empty
wineglass. “Of course they don’t, because Robert had nothing to do with it
—”
“I don’t believe it,” I said. “I believe people thought he had something to
do with it, whether he did or not. There must have been rumors.”
“Well, there were always rumors about Robert but William started
those…” Abigail stopped and just stared at me. “According to my brother…”
Abigail looked past me, almost as if she was making sure there was no one
around to hear her. “Carol had to have been standing in a certain position,
somewhere mid-railing, above the floor, in order to fall from the landing—”
“And had she been?” I cut in.
Abigail looked at me. “No one knows,” she answered quietly.
“Had she been pushed? Had she been thrown off? Is that what people
thought? What are you trying to say? Did Robert do it?”
She released her grip on the wineglass and folded her hands on the table.
“It was an accident,” she repeated. “There were irregularities, but the
cause of death was listed as an accident. No one knew why she was in a
position to fall the way she did but it was an accident.” Abby suddenly
became impatient. “This isn’t what I wanted to talk to you about. I don’t have
anything to say about what happened to Carol.”
“What did Robert say?” I asked. “About what happened to his mother?”
“He wasn’t home,” she said. “But he was the one who found her.”
“Did he have an alibi?” I couldn’t help but ask.
“An alibi?” she said, stunned. She asked it again, as if in disbelief.
“Alibi?” Her expression shifted, as if she was suddenly seeing me in a new
light and it confirmed something about the boy sitting across from her and the
word he used. Alibi.
I was just staring at Abigail, breathing deeply, trying to control myself—
the Valium wasn’t working and small threads of anxiety were unspooling all
around me in the air, tendrils creeping across the tablecloth in La Scala,
wrapping themselves around my arms, my chest, my neck. Abigail started
talking again and I tried to pay attention to what she was saying but I didn’t
want to. The noise of her voice entered in and out of my consciousness as my
eyes scanned the streets for the sight of a beige-colored van.
“Robert did have…anger issues, and, yes, he acted out, and, yes, there
were drugs—and, yes, he threatened people, classmates, and he wasn’t
focused anymore—and, yes, the marijuana and whatever else he was taking,
peyote, mushrooms, LSD, whatever, contributed to this, of course—but he
wasn’t dangerous, Bret. Except maybe to himself.” Abigail stared at me for
emphasis when she said this. “I don’t believe he was necessarily violent. In
fact there was one occasion when Robert was found in, what Carol described,
a catatonic state in his bedroom and that was when the benzodiazepine was
finally prescribed.” She paused. “As for rumors about Robert, well, William
mentioned that before Carol died she had told him there were a number of
neighborhood pets that had either disappeared or were found dead and that
she was very worried that people thought Robert had something to do with it,
and William told her he probably did.” She paused. “Yes, that is the type of
father my brother is.”
I felt sick when I heard this and I wanted her to stop talking, but I
couldn’t say anything. I suddenly remembered glimpsing Robert standing in
front of Vince’s Pets on the first floor of the Galleria in Sherman Oaks on
that September day after school, and a wave of revulsion swept through me.
Abigail kept talking.
“Nothing was ever pinned on Robert but William assumed things about
him, which just exacerbated the paranoia, his paranoia, Robert’s paranoia.”
She looked at the empty glass and then scanned the room again for the maître
d’. She sighed. “Anyway, Carol died in April, and after about a month living
with his father, when Robert was finishing his sophomore year at Roycemore,
William didn’t want Robert living with them, he said there was something
going on with Ashley, who was only twelve, something inappropriate, and so
Robert came to L.A. and stayed with me during the summer of 1980.” She
stopped talking and reached for a cigarette and lit it. She blew the smoke
away from me as I just stared at her. The maître d’ suddenly appeared and
without asking poured Abigail a third glass of white wine and then walked
over to the bar to answer the phone. The cigarette and the refilled glass
relaxed her into asking me: “And that’s when you said you saw him. Right?
At that movie theater in May.”
—
I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING because she knew Robert had been at the
Village Theater on that Saturday at the early matinee of The Shining. He had
wandered down one aisle and then up another, looking for someone. Robert
had told Abigail on September 8 that someone at school had seen him that
day—stunned that someone could have remembered him from only one
sighting. And the way Abigail looked at me in La Scala, I realized that she
knew why Robert had made such an impression and why he had stayed with
me for so long—why I still remembered this boy fifteen months after I’d first
seen him. She knew I thought he was beautiful, desirable, someone I wanted,
and this answered a number of questions about me that she didn’t need to ask.
She had figured me out. I’d been attracted to her nephew in such an impactful
way that she knew what my secret was. In some ways I barely cared, because
the fear was erasing everything, but I suddenly felt naked and lightly
ashamed in front of her. She was very relaxed now. Her trepidation about me
had disappeared—she no longer seemed to care. I was just a boy. She thought
she knew so much more than I did as she quietly got drunk. She started
talking again.
“At first, Robert seemed better when he visited me here in 1980; this was
in mid-May, after his sophomore year at Roycemore ended, though I hadn’t
experienced him in Chicago so I couldn’t really compare—in fact I had rarely
seen my nephew before,” she said. “I don’t think he was on drugs out here,
because I told Robert he couldn’t have a car if he took drugs. My husband
and I had recently separated and he had moved to Brentwood and I had
moved to Century City and he had bought a new car and left his Porsche and
I let Robert drive that. And it was just me and Robert that summer and I
really didn’t see him much at all—he was gone a lot and I didn’t ask where
he was or what he was doing. He was out most nights, and I noticed that he
had spent a lot of money on gas because of the credit card I’d given him—
and in strange places, up and down the coast, sometimes as far away as
Monterey or beyond San Diego, just driving—but he was also very social and
he met girls easily, so I just assumed he was with them.”
I’d love to put my tongue up that tight little pussy, all pink and wet…
Little honey pot…really fuck that ass hard…make her scream…
“He seemed, at first, I don’t know, to really thrive in Los Angeles,”
Abigail continued. “I don’t think there was any way he had processed his
mother’s death yet—it had only been a couple of months, it was too soon—
but he seemed okay. I assumed the impact of it would hit him later.” She
paused and then drank half the glass of wine. She had loosened up
considerably and was no longer intently focusing on me. She was just talking
freely, uninhibited. “But something had happened at the beginning of the
summer, just a month or so after Robert arrived, that was the catalyst for
Robert to vanish for days, even a week, at a time.” She inhaled on the
cigarette, exhaling a stream of smoke away from me. “This was the
beginning of the paranoia. This was when he said someone had started
following him. And this started happening after a girl Robert had been seeing
on and off…disappeared.”
She paused. I waited.
“You were right,” Abigail said. “Robert was at that theater in Westwood
on that Saturday in May.” She paused. “You did see him. He was there with a
girl.”
“With who?” I managed to ask through the dread.
“With a girl named Kathy Latchford,” she said. “Katherine Latchford.”
She paused again and studied me, curious as to what my reaction would
be to that name.
“I know who that is,” I said quietly. But my voice trembled because my
heart was beating too quickly and I found it difficult to speak.
—
“SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND why Robert didn’t want anyone to know he
had been with her, after she disappeared.” She looked at me and slightly
cocked her head. “And why he denied being there to you.” She inhaled on the
cigarette. “It was never a serious thing with Kathy. They went to the movies,
they went to a concert, Kathy was seeing a lot of different people, Robert was
going back to Chicago in September, it was casual.” Abigail paused. “There
were other boys Kathy was involved with that the police talked to after she
disappeared…”
“But not Robert,” I said.
“No, not Robert,” she confirmed.
“He didn’t come forward or…say anything?”
“No.” Abigail crushed the cigarette out in the ashtray. “He wouldn’t.
Because he said he didn’t know anything.” She paused and looked around the
room. “And I believed him.” She looked back at me. “And both his father and
myself agreed that, considering Robert’s recent problems, well, he should just
leave himself out of it.”
I didn’t say anything. I was just looking at Abigail dead-eyed. I couldn’t
believe how fast the nausea overwhelmed me—it was caused by pure panic
that the anxiety had exploded into. I just sat very still to let the sickness pass,
and then it slowly started dimming after the second wave crested. I wanted to
get out of La Scala and go home and smoke weed and take another Quaalude,
until I was stoned enough to annihilate myself and crawl under the blankets
on my bed and fall into a deep and dreamless sleep.
“So you know about Katherine Latchford and what happened to her,”
Abigail was saying.
I nodded slowly. “Yes.” I swallowed. “The Trawler.”
“Yes.” She nodded. “The first girl.”
My jaw was clenched so tightly I thought my teeth were going to crack. I
managed to unclench the jaw and murmur, “So that’s why he said he hadn’t
been at the movie.” I paused. “He didn’t want someone to make the
connection…”
Abigail continued. “There was one thing that Robert told me about
Kathy that bothered me, but there was this person who was calling her and
hanging up and she thought someone had gotten into her bedroom and
rearranged a shelf of her books and gone through a drawer of her T-shirts and
panties.” She paused. “And she told Robert a few pairs of panties were
missing.” And then Abigail was trying to focus intently on me as she spoke
so she could keep gauging my reaction to the information she was relaying
instead of just being lost in the buzz of three glasses of wine. “She thought
Robert had left her that poster, that gift, that the police became interested in
much later…” She stopped. “But he hadn’t.”
“The Madness poster,” I confirmed quietly. “For One Step Beyond.”
“Robert hadn’t left her any poster,” Abigail said. “I don’t know what the
poster was but he hadn’t left anything for her.” She paused. “Someone else
had.”
One Step Beyond. Second Edition. Three Imaginary Boys. Gang of Four.
I knew that the Foreigner 4 poster was part of this narrative.
I knew that Matt Kellner was somehow connected. But I had no idea
how.
“On that day you saw him in Westwood, Robert told me that after the
movie Kathy thought she saw someone suspicious in the parking lot, a guy, in
the distance, wearing sunglasses, someone staring at her, and so when she
disappeared from that party a few weeks later Robert assumed she was just
hiding out for a couple of days—doing drugs, probably with another boy
she’d been seeing, dealing with her paranoia.” She sipped the wine. It was
almost gone.
“Yeah?” I said, just gazing at Abigail.
“And then, when it became apparent that something was seriously wrong
and that Kathy was in fact missing, Robert said someone had begun to
follow…him.” She paused dramatically to let this land. I said nothing,
remembering what Thom told me in the car on the way to the airport: Robert
had told him he was being followed, stalked, some freak.
“And there were phone calls on his private line where no one said
anything, a number of hang-ups,” Abigail said, breathing in. “And he sensed
that when he was out in public he was being…watched. According to Robert
this never let up during that summer here in L.A., the summer Katherine was
missing and before her body was found, and on one level he just got used to
it. Sometimes he even made jokes about it, but I knew he was going through
something.” She paused. “He still thinks someone is following him. He said it
stopped in Chicago but when he returned to Los Angeles that December, to
spend the holidays with me, he felt it again—this invisible presence, he called
it. He had started receiving anonymous letters with no return address that he
never showed me—I don’t know what was in them. And then the phone calls
started up again around Christmas. It was a replay of the summer. And
Robert started breaking down.” She paused. “And of course Kathy’s body
had been found in August.”
And Sarah Johnson would disappear that first week in January, the
writer reminded me.
“Who did he think it was?” I heard myself ask and then flashed on
Robert in the Galleria when he told me: I don’t like being followed.
“He doesn’t know,” Abby said. “He never did.”
“Abby.” I breathed in. “Do you really believe him? Do you really believe
he had nothing to do with Katherine’s disappearance? And what happened to
her? You don’t think he’s capable of that?”
Her expression hardened for the first time since I’d sat down. “That
response is exactly why Robert didn’t go to the police.” She shook her head
slightly. “That response is part of the problem, Bret. The first thing he told
me when he got home from that first day of school in September was that
someone from Buckley had seen him at that movie he had gone to with Kathy
Latchford. He was panicked about it.” She paused. “He hadn’t seen you. He
doesn’t remember seeing you. He was walking around looking for Katherine
—she had been dropped off by her mother.” She paused again. “But when
you ask me something like that—is Robert capable of this, if he has an alibi,
if he was responsible for his mother’s death—it makes me realize that you
obviously think he’s sick and—”
“There’s a time line,” I said, leaning in. “Abby. There’s a time line.
Katherine disappeared when Robert was here and then her body was found
before he left. Sarah Johnson disappeared when he was here and—”
“Bret.” Abigail had raised her voice. “I don’t want to hear this.”
“Was he here in L.A. during the past summer?” I asked. “In June? Was
Robert here in June?”
“Well, um, on and off…” Abigail started. “Yes, he was here in June.
Yes.”
“So he was here when Julie Selwyn disappeared,” I said. “In June. He
was here in June.”
“Who’s Julie Selwyn?” Abigail Mallory asked, confused.
—
“WHAT HAPPENED IN CHICAGO?” I asked. “Why was Robert placed in
that facility?” I paused. “You don’t want to tell me. You can’t tell me, can
you? You don’t want me to know, because it’ll confirm something about
Robert,” I said. “You don’t want me to know.”
“I don’t know what happened, Bret,” Abigail said. “I only know what I
heard and there were two differing versions—”
“What happened?” I interrupted. “Jesus, just tell me so I can get out of
here.”
She stared at me—she was drunk and alive to the possibilities of
whatever she was going to tell me and yet she wanted to make me understand
something by defending Robert against whatever he had been accused of in
Illinois. If she had been sober I don’t think she would have been capable. But,
buzzed on three glasses of wine, she decided to be honest and give it a shot.
“It seemed that Ashley—” she began quietly.
“Who’s Ashley?” I asked, not remembering.
“His stepsister,” she said.
“Okay, Ashley.” I nodded.
“Ashley said…something happened between her and Robert.”
I stared at Abigail. “What?”
“I suspect she always had a crush on Robert, or that’s what Carol had
mentioned once or twice when I talked to her,” Abigail said. “Even though
Robert lived with his mother he occasionally stayed with his father when
Carol was away on business. And I think Ashley accused Robert of certain
things, certain sexual things that he didn’t do. But William and Diane wanted
to believe…”
“Like what?” I asked. “Like what sexual things?”
“Robert was back at Roycemore in January and wasn’t doing well—I
heard about peyote and LSD, which Robert admitted to—and he was having
problems with his father and with Diane—they hadn’t been able to find a
boarding school that Robert would agree to—and it just kept escalating
until…Ashley said something happened to her. That Robert did something to
her.”
I waited.
Abigail sighed. “She had developed a…rash and she blamed it on
Robert,” Abigail said, after taking a long pause. “She said that Robert had
done…something to her. That he had told her to…shave…” Abigail stopped.
“There was the insinuation that he had done something to her. That he had…
done something sexual to her. Robert said it wasn’t true, that she was lying,
and then…”
I waited. “And then?”
“And then Robert overdosed and I don’t think it was a serious attempt
but maybe a way to make William feel guilty about believing Ashley and
then William wanted to place Robert in that facility—he said it was to get
him clean as well as to get a complete psychiatric evaluation—and it all
happened fairly quickly. Robert was placed in Jacksonville a week after he
returned to Chicago and by the time he was released it was decided that he
should move out here with me,” she said. “Look, I just want you to
understand that he has been through a lot and I think unfairly treated. And I
think that whatever you want to hang on him is also unfair and dangerous and
I want you to—”
I leaned in again. I could feel my skin reddening. I was suddenly furious.
“He was with Matt Kellner, okay, Abby?” I said quietly. “The week Matt
disappeared he knew where Matt was, and I have a tape that was made the
night Matt died and I believe the other voice on it is Robert’s and that he
helped fucking kill him—”
“Stop it—”
“I believe that on that weekend Matt came over to the house on Benedict
Canyon and that Robert drugged him and that he drove him down the coast to
Crystal Cove and that he beat the shit out of him and then drove him back
and this is just a fucked-up game Robert likes to play—”
“Stop it, Bret, please—”
“And he staged it to look like Matt drowned after a psychotic break—”
“You have to stop this, Bret—”
Abigail had reached for the pack of cigarettes and then dropped her hand.
“Robert cut his fucking cat’s head off, Abby. Your fucking nephew
nailed it to a column. He gutted it—”
“Robert already talked to Ronald Kellner, Bret.” She looked up at me
and there were tears in her eyes.
“You don’t believe he was involved with the home invasions that began
when he was here in the summer of 1980? Along with the assaults and
Katherine Latchford disappearing?” I said. “The time line fits. The time line
completely fits. He was here when Sarah Johnson disappeared and he was
here when Julie Selwyn disappeared and he wasn’t on the goddamn field at
school the night Audrey Barbour disappeared.” I stopped, exhausted. “He
was in fucking Woodland Hills, stalking her at the Promenade—”
“I don’t really know who those other girls are. I guess I haven’t been
following this as closely as you, Bret,” Abigail said softly. “I’m not sure I
know who those girls are exactly.”
“So it’s just bad luck that Robert dated the girl who was the first victim
of the Trawler,” I said. “And bad luck that his twelve-year-old stepsister said
he raped her—”
“You have to stop accusing him of things,” she said. “He has no one. He
has no one but me—”
“Stop it,” I said. “Just stop it—”
But a sudden pang expanded in my chest when she said this because I
felt the same way about myself: You have no one either.
—
SHE LEANED ACROSS the table—the desperation was palpable. “You
should get to know him, Bret,” she said quietly. “I think if you knew him
you’d realize it wouldn’t be possible for him to do what you’re suggesting.”
She stopped and then sat back. She reached for the pack of cigarettes, picked
one out but refrained from lighting it. And then she suddenly looked slightly
confused. “How…did you know about the house on Benedict Canyon?”
“I don’t remember,” I automatically lied. “I think Robert mentioned it to
a group of us at lunch or something,” I muttered. “There was some house on
Benedict he mentioned…” I didn’t tell her I’d followed Robert there and that
I roamed the backyard.
“It’s where my husband and I first lived. He’s now in Scottsdale. He
hasn’t put the house on the market because he has to give me half of it. He’s
being a prick.” She was having trouble focusing on me. I realized she was
trying to light the cigarette and for some reason couldn’t. “Robert keeps some
things there. Upstairs. He has a key.”
I was overwhelmed. I finally stood up. I looked at her blankly. In that
moment I saw Abigail Mallory as a clueless drunk and I wondered how many
times she had censored herself during our conversation. Even though she
seemed afraid and vulnerable she made me feel pitiless, as if I was capable of
wiping her out. “You want me to be friends with him?” I asked quietly. “You
want me to hang out with Robert?”
She looked up at me but didn’t nod.
“I’ll hang out with him. Whatever.” I realized my back was completely
damp with sweat and fused with my Polo shirt. “You want me to be nice to
him? Fine. Whatever.” I said this numbly, with no emotion.
Her face relaxed and she seemed surprised. “That easily?” she asked
softly. “You’ve changed your mind that easily?”
“I haven’t changed my mind about anything,” I said.
She stared at me, confused.
“I’m worried about what’s going to happen to Susan Reynolds,” I said.
“I’m worried about what he’s going to do to Susan.”
24
I DIDN’T GO TO SCHOOL on Thursday—I couldn’t handle the notion of it
after what was revealed to me at La Scala Boutique and so I stayed in bed
with the comforter swathed around my body. I overslept, even with Rosa
trying to wake me up and walking into my room to assist a whimpering
Shingy, who was scratching at the door that led onto the deck, as I fell in and
out of sleep. I spent the day going over the conversation I’d had with Abigail
Mallory while ignoring phone calls from Debbie and trying to concentrate on
homework with the help of the dwindling supply of weed I’d bought from
Jeff on Sunday. What happened in La Scala Boutique could become, if I let
it, my only point of reference, and I needed to be distracted from it, and the
bowls I kept smoking from the glass pipe helped me focus on other things.
That night I took a Quaalude to zone out and easily fell asleep, and on Friday
I dutifully got out of bed when the alarm I’d set the night before began
quietly beeping on my nightstand and went through the morning ritual,
though I didn’t jerk off that day—I had no desire. I swam, took a shower, got
dressed in the Buckley uniform, glanced over the homework I had completed
the night before and then stared at myself in the mirror and realized I looked
good, I looked normal, I looked friendly, I looked calm, I was the tangible
participant and I was going to get along with everybody that day. And I was
going to become Robert Mallory’s friend—because there wasn’t any choice.
As I walked toward the bell tower with the Gucci backpack slung over
my shoulder I took notice of everyone’s cars in the parking lot: there were
Susan’s and Debbie’s respective BMWs, there was Ryan’s black Trans Am
and Robert’s Porsche—everyone was there but me. (Then I remembered:
Thom Wright’s Corvette wasn’t there either.) It was almost nine o’clock and
American Fiction was about to begin. Slaughterhouse Five had been assigned
and I’d quickly read the first half of the novel the day before, stoned, out by
the pool, after I called Buckley and told one of the secretaries that I wasn’t
feeling well and wouldn’t be coming to school that day—there was no
suspicion in her voice, only concern and understanding; this was how
Buckley worked, this was what being a senior meant, this was the privilege
we’d inherited. Susan smiled at me as I took the seat next to hers and I smiled
back reassuringly and then I nodded over at Ryan, who hesitantly nodded at
me, as if surprised I’d acknowledged him, and then class began. The day
really became effortless once you faked it and it actually became more real
because of your changed demeanor; the act became the reality and it affected
everything in what seemed like a positive way. In fact, it was preferable to
reality.
—
BY THE TIME lunch was playing itself out, with just Debbie and Susan and
Robert and myself occupying the center table beneath the shadow of the
Pavilion, I had metamorphosed into so many people I actually wasn’t: I was
now Debbie Schaffer’s amiably amorous boyfriend, telling her I’d spent
Thursday at home thinking about us and how I wanted—and needed—to be
more committed to us, and I promised her I had vanquished the zombie who
had overtaken me earlier that semester. I was now constantly touching and
caressing her and kissing her on the lips every time we ran into each other
between classes on that Friday, and though I begged off on her coming over
to the house on Mulholland for a quick fuck after school she didn’t argue,
because she was not only so touched by my newfound allegiance but too
preoccupied with the equestrian charity event, which was far more glamorous
and extravagant than I’d supposed—it would be televised, there were
sponsors, there were movie and TV stars attending, it was tied into something
bigger I couldn’t comprehend. Spirit had been acting nervous and skittish and
needed to refocus on his performance, Debbie would mention to me,
something had spooked him—and she was training the horse daily in order to
calm him because it was a complicated routine, and she was almost
constantly in Malibu when she wasn’t at Buckley. I acted concerned and
asked the appropriate questions even though I was completely bored and
didn’t care—and she, in turn, was giddy and relieved that I was so attentive
and at one point suspiciously asked me if I was high on something and I
assured her I wasn’t—“only you,” I added. What was happening was real, I
insisted. And then, because of my admission, Debbie told me she was
disappointed with herself and that it was her fault that we hadn’t been able to
spend more time together and I reassured her that we’d completely reconnect
when the charity event was over and that I was looking forward to being in
the stands to support her. When I said this she was so surprised on that last
Friday in October she looked happier than I’d ever seen her, and I wondered
why I hadn’t accepted this way of being in June, when we fell on that chaise
longue by the lit pool at Anthony Matthews’s house and I let the relationship
start to take us to the unsteady place where we were now at. I hoped it wasn’t
too late.
—
I WAS ALSO THE BEST FRIEND to Susan Reynolds—I stopped her in the
pathway under the eaves after our first class and held her hand as I sincerely
told her how sorry I was about Palm Springs and that it was her life and I
loved her no matter what she decided and I’d never tell Thom and please
forgive me. Susan was too exquisitely numb to break down with relief but her
eyes teared up and she hugged me tightly as Ryan Vaughn passed by with a
blank expression, heading to his next class, ignoring me, but even that was
okay, because I now understood that it was never going to happen with us
anyway—that had always been the painful reality.
“Thank you,” Susan said.
“I’m really going to try, I’m really there for you,” I said. “And I’m going
to try and be friends with Robert,” I said. “Matt’s death messed me up—I’ve
gotten everything so wrong,” I told her.
I tried not to zone out during assembly when I suffered a brief and
painful moment that unexpectedly broke the tangible participant: I noticed
Thom’s absence—it was suddenly undeniable and everywhere. A huge part
of Buckley was missing without him. I couldn’t believe how much I craved
his presence and in a panic immediately willed the tangible participant back
and turned this desire about Thom onto Robert, and while the sea of blue
blazers intoned the Pledge of Allegiance and the Buckley Prayer I leaned in
to Robert and apologized for what had happened at Hamburger Hamlet on
Tuesday night in Westwood: it was all a joke, it was all a misunderstanding,
and I was really, really sorry. Robert acted totally unfazed and shrugged it
off. He leaned in and said in a low voice, “It’s cool, dude.”
—
THIS KINDNESS CONTINUED at lunch, when I—along with Debbie and
Susan—tried explaining to Robert my “weird” sense of humor and how
perverse I could get, pushing things into uncomfortable realms or just
embellishing stuff, and warned him not to take it too personally and again
apologized for any discomfort I might have caused. I was just a writer, we
had issues, we had problems, we were all a little nuts. The girls had
apparently been filled in about what happened at Hamburger Hamlet in
Westwood the other night, and though Debbie accepted it as just another
facet of myself as a writer, Susan seemed more hesitant, because she had
actually heard firsthand from me what I’d been thinking about Robert and his
connection to Matt Kellner, but on that Friday she seemed grateful I was
making an effort and appreciated the fact that I was preparing myself for
whatever was going to happen between her and Robert Mallory.
I made a point at lunch to remind Robert that I was still up for seeing a
movie with him and hanging out this weekend if he’d like to. “Maybe we
could all do something together,” I innocently suggested.
And then the girls reminded me that it was Terry’s party Saturday night
and somehow it was suddenly decided that the tangible participant should go
with Robert to Stone Canyon, just the two of us, together. Susan was already
going to be there with Debbie, getting their hair done by José Éber and their
makeup by Rick Gillette, something arranged by Liz Schaffer, who was
always professionally made up before any kind of public appearance.
“Yeah,” Debbie said brightly. “Why don’t the two of you come together?” I
was shocked by this request but I smiled and looked over at Robert, who
shrugged and said, “Sure, I guess.”
This was the last thing I wanted to do but it was also, I realized, part of a
plan I began constructing, a new story I wanted to write.
—
ON SATURDAY NIGHT I headed over to Century City in the 450SL with
the top up—it had taken me longer than I expected to get my hair exactly
how I liked it. Evita was still playing at the Shubert Theater in the ABC
Entertainment Center and the valet in front was lined with waiting cars and
behind the valet a large crowd had gathered and was entering the lobby, the
Century Towers looming closer in the darkness as I drove toward them on
Avenue of the Stars. I pulled past the white brick wall announcing the
Century Towers in gold cursive lettering and told the security guard I was
there to pick up Robert Mallory and he instructed me to check in at the front
desk in the lobby of the building that was situated closest to Pico Boulevard
and then directed me to a parking spot. The circular fountain was lit blue and
dancing with water as I walked toward the entrance of the tower and into a
spare and modern lobby with a crystal chandelier hanging over a waiting area
consisting of a floral-patterned couch and a pair of armchairs that bracketed a
glass coffee table where a lone orchid sat. The space exuded sleekness: stone
floors, a vaulted ceiling. There was a man in a uniform at the front desk,
which was set off to the right side as you entered the vast lobby, who barely
noticed me as I walked up to him announcing my arrival. The elevator bank
was directly parallel to the glass doors of the entrance and I could have
walked straight to them unnoticed and bypassed the front desk altogether, but
I followed protocol and checked in, even though Robert was expecting me.
The doorman lifted a phone, waited, and then told whoever had picked
up that “Bret” was here; after a beat, the doorman said “Certainly” and then
told me I could go up, gesturing toward the elevator banks.
—
ABIGAIL MALLORY’S condo was a penthouse at the top of the twentyeight-story building, and as I stood in the quickly rising elevator I felt a
strange calm lightly reverberating with a faint erotic charge—there was
something I found so intimate about walking into the condo where Robert
resided and where he combated his insanity with the routine of a normal
seventeen-year-old boy: maybe he slept naked, or maybe he wore pajamas,
maybe he jerked off when he showered, I imagined him eating meals, a bowl
of cereal, and getting dressed and undressed, using the bathroom, doing his
homework, and yet I also imagined him dreaming about planning another
abduction, creating another assemblage depending on the current lunar cycle,
using Susan Reynolds’s body as the source of the alterations and what the
Trawler called the remakings. I was entering into Robert’s world that night
and I hadn’t fully realized until I was shooting up to the twenty-eighth floor
how badly I’d desired this—there was a sexual tinge attached to it.
The elevator door opened and I walked into a hallway and looked around
—and when I saw a door slightly ajar I realized it was the entrance to
Abigail’s penthouse. I knocked and loudly said, “Hello?” I heard Robert call
back from somewhere in the condo, “Hey, I’ll be out in a sec,” and then the
sound of a blow-dryer.
I entered into a massive living room with a marble floor and dimmed
recessed lighting, which accentuated the stunning views spread out behind a
window wall overlooking West Hollywood and the hills of Sunset in the far
distance. There was an opened sliding glass door that led onto a balcony
where a chaise longue and a small table sat, and past the edge of the balcony
was the Hillcrest Country Club and Rancho Park. And far below a series of lit
tennis courts bordered a darkened golf course next to where traffic flowed on
Pico Boulevard. It was completely silent on the balcony—the world below
the penthouse seemed very far away.
Everything about the condo was minimalist: the sleek sectional that took
up most of the space in the living room was light gray and modern, and
suggested nothing comfortable. A large print of the Hockney painting
Portrait of an Artist hung on a wall next to the white granite fireplace and it
was the blue of the pool, the green of the hills, and the pink blazer of the boy
that seemed to be the only real color in the otherwise stark monochromatic
room. There was a dining area beneath a chandelier where, at a rectangular
glass table, eight anonymous high-backed gray-cushioned chairs sat; I
assumed it was never used, judging how barren the condo was. This room
flowed into a surprisingly narrow kitchen that was completely uncluttered
with objects. I noticed a knife rack next to a blender, and a few tangerines
piled in a ceramic bowl on a wooden cutting board. The blow-dryer had
stopped and Robert called out, “I’m in here,” expecting me to locate him
from the vague direction of his voice. I walked slowly down a hallway—the
marble became hardwood floors and there were no paintings or photographs
on the walls—until I came to a room whose door was open.
—
THE FIRST THING I noticed was a bulky TV that sat on a stand in the
corner, and because it was Halloween, Night of the Living Dead was playing
—it had just started—and the spare black-and-white images complemented
the décor of the gray bedroom, which had the same sweeping view of L.A. as
the rest of the condo and was just as chic and minimal, and also looked as if
no one lived there. It wasn’t decorated for permanence—it was a transitory
space, barely furnished, with a queen-sized bed tightly fitted with a light-gray
comforter that melded in with the gray headboard and the flat gray carpet that
surrounded it. A desk, a set of drawers, a nightstand with a lamp, all minimal
and nondescript—and I also noticed there wasn’t a phone in Robert’s room
and wondered where the phone with the number I found in Matt Kellner’s
drawer was located. (My mind immediately flashed: it was at Benedict
Canyon.) There were no posters, there weren’t any books except for the
mass-market paperback of Slaughterhouse Five we were reading in American
Fiction that lay folded open-faced down on the desk. There wasn’t a stereo,
just a boom box with a couple of cassettes scattered around it.
Robert was standing in a walk-in closet, knotting a crimson tie in front of
a full-length mirror. I stopped, stunned at how handsome Robert looked that
night, tall and sleek in a simple fitted black suit with a white dress shirt. I was
also wearing a suit but it was assembled from a variety of pieces: a Polo
button-down and slacks from I. Magnin along with the tweed jacket I favored
that year, a Gucci belt, an Armani tie and black penny loafers. Robert’s
simplicity was classic and timeless and I imagined I looked like a preppie oaf
by comparison. He had styled and combed back his hair, which accentuated
the angles of his face, and I almost didn’t recognize him even though I’d seen
him only the day before. I realized he was taking Terry’s party seriously in a
way that I no longer could—he badly wanted to make an impression and I
didn’t care anymore; this had been zapped out of me in the bungalow at the
Beverly Hills Hotel weeks ago. He smiled genuinely as he walked out of the
closet and then checked himself in a mirror in the bathroom adjacent to the
stark bedroom. I noticed a bottle of cologne and various toiletries and an
array of seashells carefully arranged next to the sink, which I zoned out on
while Robert inspected himself before he switched off a light and the
bathroom went dark.
I thought I had come up for a drink but I heard him say, “Let’s go,” as I
stared at the boom box and wondered if it was what Robert used to record
Matt as he was breaking him down in Crystal Cove the last night of Matt’s
life, and how many ski masks did Robert keep in the chest of drawers by the
television playing Night of the Living Dead?
But I forced a smile and said, “Let’s do it,” and then added, “We’re
running a little late.”
He nodded okay and smiled at me again and it was hard to believe that
this was the smile of a boy who had tried to kill himself, according to Abigail
Mallory, less than a year ago in his bedroom in Chicago.
—
ELTON JOHN’S “FUNERAL for a Friend” started playing on KLOS as we
drove from Century City toward Bel Air.
I took Avenue of the Stars and would make a left onto Santa Monica and
then drive South Beverly Glen until it hit Bel Air Road where I’d swing right
onto Bellagio, which would take us to Stone Canyon—it was a simple route,
maybe ten minutes; the Schaffers lived up the street from the Bel Air Hotel
and there’d be a valet, so we wouldn’t have to worry about finding a parking
space. Nothing much was said as I drove: the drama of the music was what
he seemed to concentrate on, though I was so acutely aware of Robert’s
presence that I barely heard the song; his scent lightly filled the cabin of the
Mercedes: clean, the ocean, the drift of sandalwood, it suggested purity,
something fresh and erotic. I wanted to tell him how good he smelled but
refrained, just concentrating on the rising intensity of the song. It could have
been any night in L.A.: we didn’t pass anyone trick-or-treating and traffic
was sparse on that Saturday.
Whatever conversation we had on the drive to Bel Air was so tentative
and perfunctory—we didn’t mention the girls, neither of us mentioned Thom
Wright, Robert never said anything about his aunt meeting me on Wednesday
in Beverly Hills, and not a whisper about last weekend in Palm Springs. But
there wasn’t anything awkward about the situation either—he seemed
silenced by the anticipation of the party and he was into the song, with him at
one point air-drumming, and soon I was more relaxed, focusing on the
upcoming traffic signal at Beverly Glen and Sunset when “Funeral for a
Friend” gave way to “Love Lies Bleeding” and in that moment I thought I
saw the beige-colored van pull up behind us, just before I drove through the
light on Beverly Glen and toward Bel Air’s East Gate, but when I glanced
again at the rearview mirror I watched as the headlights veered left onto
Sunset and sped away, toward Westwood.
This happened so fast that I almost didn’t have time to process the van or
connect any meaning to it and yet felt a sharp panic, even though I couldn’t
be sure if it was the van. But why did I feel any fear? It was just a van. I was
attaching something to it that hadn’t even announced itself yet. It was just a
beige-colored van whose license plates I’d never bothered to notice. It was
just a flash, it was just an image, maybe it was nothing, maybe I was
imagining it, and the force of Robert’s presence and the expectation of
Terry’s party overrode any ominous thoughts that might have lingered. “Love
Lies Bleeding” kept playing as we climbed the streets to Stone Canyon
toward the Schaffers’ mansion, and I didn’t say anything to Robert about the
van but I’d begun wondering: Was the van following me? Or, I thought, was
the van following Robert?
—
I PULLED up to the valet stand in the circular driveway, where a surfer in
white jeans and a white Polo shirt jogged around the hood of the car to open
the driver’s-side door as another surfer opened the passenger side, and when I
got out the surfer handed me a ticket. There was a small army of surfer valets
that night, opening doors and escorting women and men from a series of
Mercedes and Porsches and Jaguars and Rolls, quickly moving the line of
cars out of the driveway. The surfers were a Terry Schaffer touch: his parties
always had an all-male staff consisting of young good-looking dudes who
acted as valets, bartenders, servers, waiters, because supposedly the women
who attended the parties didn’t want their spouses and boyfriends distracted
by hot young chicks offering them canapés and pouring champagne: just
another piece of etiquette in the social world of Terry Schaffer that seemed
practical and I admired.
I joined Robert and as we walked up the steps toward the open door of
the house, where the butler, Paul, in uniform, warmly greeted the guests,
ushering them in, Robert leaned in to me and asked, “Is that Jacqueline
Bisset?”
I hadn’t noticed and turned to see the actress heading toward us with a
brooding platinum-blond hulk who I realized was Alexander Godunov, the
Russian ballet dancer who had defected to the United States a couple of years
previous, and they were now a couple.
“Yeah,” I said in a low voice.
“God, she’s so hot,” Robert said, hushed, as Paul recognized me and
nodded and then I introduced him to Robert. “He goes to Buckley with us,” I
said, expecting Paul would care and, of course, he pretended to—that was
part of his job as the Schaffers’ butler.
“Nice to meet you, Robert,” Paul said graciously. “Please come in.”
And then Paul leaned in to me and said, “Deborah and Susan are out by
the pool, and supper will be served at nine.”
Stepping into the foyer, I noticed that this party was darker than others,
with candles flickering everywhere as the main source of light, and couples
were casually sitting on the steps of the grand curving staircase and there
were guests upstairs on the landing as well, everyone holding drinks and
flatteringly lit by the burning candles.
—
AS WE STEPPED into the packed living room I realized why everything was
darker than usual: this was one of Terry’s starrier parties, and I noticed that
Steven Reinhardt wasn’t around to photograph the celebrities who had
stopped by that night because this was a private event and it wasn’t
promoting anything. Terry’s parties weren’t particularly lavish—they were
cool, understated affairs, and there was a low-key, tossed-off attitude about
them that made the movie stars in attendance seem all the more startling.
Sometimes there were no reasons for the party—it was just Terry Schaffer
hosting on a Saturday night and everyone simply came. The living room was
flickering with candlelight and loud with voices that drowned out the music
—mostly seventies rock and recent disco hits, “You Make Loving Fun” by
Fleetwood Mac was playing—as I led Robert to the bar set up in the corner,
manned by two surfer bartenders. Robert wasn’t drinking but I asked for a
beer and was handed an ice-cold Corona with a wedge of lime that I pushed
through the bottle’s neck. I’d been attending Terry’s parties since I’d turned
sixteen, and invited by Debbie because we were friends, and for some reason
that was the age at which Terry started allowing us in, and I was surprised
how quickly jaded I’d become: I liked movies and movie stars but I also liked
secrets, and seeing them in the flesh diminished their power for me.
But this was Robert’s first Terry Schaffer party and he slowly looked
around the living room as if stunned: Paul Newman was talking to Dudley
Moore with Susan Anton towering over him. Jane Fonda was explaining
something to Terry—it had been announced in the trades she was going to
star in a movie Terry was producing but it never happened. I hadn’t seen
Terry since that afternoon at the Beverly Hills Hotel and I suddenly felt both
emboldened and ashamed and looked away after he first noticed Robert and
then me and lifted his drink. A director whose work I was enamored with—
Walter Hill—was holding a tumbler and leaning in to Mel Gibson, whom I’d
excitedly seen at the last party Terry threw, but on that Halloween night he
just didn’t have the same sexual impact. I was, however, still intrigued by the
filmmakers I noticed in the crowd and knew that Robert wouldn’t recognize:
Tony Richardson, Franco Zeffirelli, Herbert Ross, John Schlesinger, and
James Bridges, who was talking to John Travolta. I looked back at Terry,
who kept listening to something Jane Fonda was telling him but was staring
at Robert too intently, and I became completely unnerved.
I told Robert we should go outside and find the girls.
—
A LARGE GROUP had gathered by the glowing rectangle of the pool, next
to another bar manned by surfers, and Robert stood for a moment to take in
the vast yard dotted with Tiki torches, music coming from speakers hidden in
the trees—“Brandy” by Looking Glass—a white tent set up and filled with
thirty circular candlelit dining tables with ten folding chairs at each and a
buffet being laid out by a group of uniformed servers.
Robert breathed in and then actually looked at me as he took in the
grounds and said, “Amazing.”
The smokers were usually outside even though cigarettes were allowed
in the house, and Robert nudged me as we walked down the flagstone path to
the pool: he had already spotted Jack Nicholson puffing on a Marlboro and
standing with Angelica Huston and Diane Keaton and Warren Beatty, who
had taken a break from busily editing Reds in New York, and Barry Diller,
who was running Paramount at the time—the studio would be releasing
Beatty’s film in December. “This is crazy,” Robert muttered as we moved
closer to the crowd by the pool, where Liz Schaffer was smoking a cigarette
in one hand and holding a near-empty glass in the other, stunningly put
together in Halston, looking far younger than thirty-eight, and she was talking
to Steve Martin and Carrie Fisher. Liz noticed me but only smiled tightly and
turned away without any other acknowledgment, which I found oddly
startling, and then she laughed at something Carrie said. I assumed her
reticence was due to the embarrassment she felt because of the last time I’d
seen her, drunk and naked beneath an opened Bijan robe in the living room
on the Sunday before Labor Day.
I finished the first Corona and ordered another one when we arrived at
the pool bar. Billie, the golden retriever, wandered out from wherever he’d
been placed for the night and was padding around searching for affection and
I petted him but Robert didn’t—he just stared at the animal without interest,
then looked away. Robert followed me as we walked around the crowd
gathered by the pool and onto the lawn, the candlelit house looming above us,
the windows flickering, though the fully staffed kitchen remained brightly lit.
The two of us headed toward the stairs that led up to Debbie’s room, because
I assumed that’s where the girls were, and then we stopped: Susan and
Debbie were already carefully stepping down the stairs as we stood on the
lawn rising up to the house; we waited silently as they neared us. They were
both wearing vintage strapless taffeta dresses—Debbie’s was pink, Susan’s
was black—and the first things I noticed were how the dresses accentuated
their cleavage and I was shocked that Debbie had colored her hair—it was no
longer platinum but an ashier blond, more natural-looking—and it was a
different cut, less harsh and more girlish. And their makeup, from where we
stood, seemed simple, just mascara and pink lipstick, and I couldn’t
understand what the makeup artist had accomplished, though as they got
closer it became apparent: there was a flawless, understated radiance to their
complexions. Susan was wearing a strand of pearls and Debbie wore a pair of
black jade earrings and a matching black bangle on her wrist, a cool New
Wave contrast with the elegant pink dress. They were holding empty
champagne flutes as they moved toward us across the lawn, and I wondered
if they’d been sharing coke in Debbie’s bedroom. I also wondered if Thom’s
name ever came up anymore when they talked.
“I’m not going to drink too much, so I can drive you home whenever
you’d like,” I told Robert before the girls walked over to us.
He looked at me. “You’re not staying with Debbie tonight?”
I took a swig from the Corona bottle and looked back at him. “No,” I
said. “I hadn’t planned on it. Why?” I realized my voice had a slightly
confused tone.
“Oh, well, don’t worry about it,” Robert said. “I’m good. I’ll be fine.”
“Okay,” I said tentatively, and then, “How are you getting back?”
“Susan’s driving me,” he said, as the girls got closer.
I immediately asked, “Where?”
Robert calmly said, “Century City.”
“Oh. Okay.” I nodded quickly. And then backed up. “Wait, I don’t
understand,” I said like a fool.
“There was a reason I asked my aunt if she’d like to head up to Santa
Barbara for the weekend,” Robert said in a low voice.
“Oh, so you could have the condo to yourself,” I said, nodding. I thought
I was going to be sick. Something cracked open within me that could never
be sealed again.
“Okay, I get it,” I said. Why don’t you just take her to Benedict Canyon?
the writer wanted me to ask. Because Robert didn’t know that I knew about
the house on Benedict Canyon, I replied to the writer.
“And Susan might be staying over,” Robert confirmed. “I don’t know.
It’s an option.”
“Oh, okay,” I said. “I didn’t know that. Cool.”
“But that’s just between you and me,” Robert said. “Right?”
“Oh yeah, yeah, of course, right,” I said, having no idea what that meant
exactly. “I won’t say anything.”
—
MINDLESS FORMALITIES about our arrival time (we were late) and how
well “you boys” cleaned up and what movie stars Robert had seen became
the jumbled dialogue I couldn’t follow because I was having trouble
breathing. I gripped the Corona bottle to steady myself. I realized an anxiety
attack was imminent and I wanted to be alone—I didn’t want anyone to see
me as I broke down. Debbie took my hand as Robert and I helped lead the
girls, balancing in their high heels, on the sloping lawn back to the pool so
they could refill their flutes with champagne. I could only imagine how
messed up the expression on my face was: a crumpling grimace. I tried to
keep it together but Debbie was saying something to me that I couldn’t hear
because I was watching Susan’s hand clenching Robert’s—this particular
intimacy was allowable now. I was blindly moving toward the pool, which
had become blurry, when I suddenly told Debbie I needed to go back into the
house and use the restroom. “Use mine,” she said, gesturing to the stairs
leading up to her room.
“No, it’s okay,” I said. “I’ll be right back.”
A series of jump cuts and I was barely aware that I’d floated through the
open French doors and into the candlelit living room, which seemed even
more packed and louder than before—“One of These Nights” by the Eagles
was playing, I wrote down in my journal later that night—and was now
asking the bartender for another beer and then changed my mind and ordered
a vodka on the rocks. I needed something stronger, or maybe I would cool
down if I simply drank nothing, maybe just a Perrier or a Coke. And then I
felt a hand clasp mine as I took the tumbler of vodka. It was Terry’s.
“I was looking for you,” he said, grinning, buzzed. “Come with me. I
want to show you something.”
“Terry,” I said. “I’ve gotta go back outside. Debbie’s waiting for me.”
He had already turned away and started pulling me through the crowd by
my wrist until we walked up the steps out of the living room and across the
foyer, where Terry passed by the guests hanging on the stairs, and I followed
him down the hallway toward his office and a bathroom no one was using
and I let him drag me in and shut the door behind us and lock it.
He immediately pushed me against the counter and roughly kissed my
mouth. Both of us were holding drinks, and I had to be careful finding a place
near the sink I could set the glass down while Terry continued devouring my
lips and tongue until I started pushing him away. I realized he was on the
cusp of totally wasted and this enforced his horniness and when he dropped
to his knees and began unzipping my slacks I just leaned against the counter
and was almost grateful that something else had eradicated the anxiety and
bad mood and dread I was experiencing—this was comical by comparison.
“Terry, come on,” I finally said, when it became apparent I wasn’t getting
hard and I leaned over and lifted him up by his armpits. He was wearing a
black suit and a dress shirt and it was unbuttoned to the middle of his chest—
it was supposed to be sexy, masculine, and maybe at another time it might
have worked for me but not on that night. Terry smiled drunkenly and
pressed against me. “I want to suck your cock,” he said matter-of-factly. “Is
there anything wrong with that?” he asked, weaving. “You liked it the last
time,” he said in a singsong voice. I didn’t know what to say—I just wanted
to get out of the bathroom and away from Terry. “Yeah, maybe, but later,” I
said, trying to placate him. “I can’t, just not here.” He kissed me again, his
mouth tasting like vodka and weed, and I was calm about it; in fact I was
kissing him back, but I hoped this was enough, because I felt no excitement
even as he continued massaging my crotch.
Finally Terry realized it wasn’t happening and backed off and checked
himself in the mirror. He reached into the pocket of his blazer and pulled out
a small vial of cocaine and held it up to me. “Maybe this will get you in the
mood,” he said, again in that singsong voice, and I realized I had never seen
Terry quite this high—he was on the verge of seriously trashed. He
unscrewed the top and dipped the tiny spoon into the vial and quickly snorted
two bumps before offering it to me. I shook my head, declined. “You’re no
fun tonight,” he said mock-sadly. There wasn’t any point in bringing up the
screenplay and I realized that dream was over—I’d have to wait for him to
mention it again, if he ever would. He checked his nostrils in the mirror and
then patted his hair into place.
“Who’s that stunner you’re with?” He sniffed and looked away from the
mirror at me, waiting for an answer.
“His name is Robert,” I said quietly. “He’s a new kid at Buckley.”
Terry whistled and then said “Woof” and the way he said this made me
reach for the tumbler of vodka and down it in one gulp.
“He’s straight,” I said wearily.
Terry smiled at me and said, “We’ll see about that.” It was supposed to
be a joke but the way Terry said it, drunk and high, made it sound like
something menacing, a threat. “Ready to roll?” Terry asked, opening the
bathroom door. “I actually need to use the…” I gestured at the toilet.
“Go for it,” Terry said, exiting the bathroom; he headed back into the din
of his party, almost tripping over the edge of the carpet lining the hallway,
and then regained his balance by placing a hand against the wall.
I turned and looked at myself in the mirror without closing the door—
there was no one in this part of the house. I used a hand towel to wipe Terry’s
saliva off my penis and then tossed it in the hamper and zipped up my slacks.
I washed my hands and then lowered my head toward the faucet and drank
from it, cleansing my mouth. I left the bathroom and wandered toward the
foyer: I was going to head up the staircase to Debbie’s room, where I’d
decompress before I went back outside to rejoin the party, but I got
interrupted and briefly found myself in a conversation with the director John
Schlesinger, who remembered me because at the last party I’d told him I
liked The Day of the Locust, his 1975 adaptation of the Nathanael West
novel, and this had intrigued him and he ended up mildly flirting with me,
especially when I started asking him questions about the movie he made that
helped me fall in love with Richard Gere, the World War II drama Yanks—
though I never told him about my crush on the actor. On that Saturday night
in October we briefly talked about how maybe I could stay with him and
Michael in Palm Springs now that the season was beginning and the weather
was cooler, and then Anthony Perkins joined us and I said I had to excuse
myself and get something for Debbie and then climbed over the couples
lounging on the staircase and walked the darkened hallway to Debbie’s room,
where I pushed open the door, closed it and then headed for the bed, and lay
down on the coral-pink comforter, shutting my eyes.
—
THE VODKA along with the two beers stabilized me but I needed something
else if I wanted to go back to the party. I sat up and looked around the room:
at the wall of shelves lined with ribbons and trophies and a bookcase where
two hardcover Judith Krantz novels were prominently displayed, at the rows
of cassette tapes and the expensive stereo, at the posters overlapping each
other on one wall of the room—they were always being replaced, depending
on Debbie’s whim. I opened the drawer of the nightstand by the bed and
rummaged through it: the Buckley roster, a tin of Djarum clove cigarettes,
bracelets and rings, ticket stubs, Polaroids of Debbie and me at the Seven
Seas over the summer, various photos of Debbie and Susan goofing off,
another Polaroid of Thom Wright in just a swimsuit standing at the edge of
the Schaffers’ pool (why?) and then, in the second drawer, there were a few
small packets of coke I wasn’t interested in, a large square hand mirror
dusted with it, a white phallic-shaped vibrator, a small pad with phone
numbers next to the names “D. Henley” and “B. Squire” and “Shore Lanes,”
a name I didn’t recognize, as well as a paperback copy of Sydney Omarr’s
1981 Leo forecast, and then I found what I was looking for: a canister of pills
and multicolored capsules. I opened the canister and poured the contents into
my palm and sorted through them to find the Valium, which I located easily;
I swallowed one and then placed three in the pocket of the tweed blazer,
along with, just in case, a Quaalude. I wouldn’t drink anything else, so I’d be
able to drive home—it would all work out, I thought morosely.
On the edge of the bed I waited for the Valium to take effect. I stared at
the pink rotary phone and the copy of The Beverly Hills Diet that had sat next
to it all summer and then thought about leaving the party without telling
anyone. I badly wanted to make the escape but I also knew that it would
cause too much drama: I was essentially trapped by the party, and what I had
let myself so passively drift into with Debbie Schaffer. I had tricked her and
was paying the price, I thought, as I stared over at the wall of posters,
deflated: the burning “X” of the Los Angeles poster, Pink Floyd’s The Wall,
the Go-Go’s wearing only towels and face cream, the Talking Heads’ Remain
in Light, Prince, a poster of the Police, Oingo Boingo, and a poster I hadn’t
remembered seeing before—it was retro and plain, something from what
looked like the early 1970s and not as up-to-date as Debbie liked to consider
herself: a quintet of black faces floating in space and smiling, the three men
lightly bearded, the two women with smooth, flat hair. It reminded me of
something my parents owned, a relic from another time, and brought a
memory back from childhood that I was about to locate and define when I
was startled by the sudden ringing of the pink rotary phone on the nightstand.
I actually gasped because it had been so silent in the room—the sounds of the
party outside just a distant ambient hum. Debbie’s answering machine picked
up. The person who called didn’t say anything—it was silent for about five
seconds and then they hung up. I left the room through the doorway that took
me to the stairs outside.
—
THE FIRST THING I noticed was Terry Schaffer talking to Robert Mallory,
standing away from the group by the pool, alone on the lawn, only the two of
them, both in their black suits, Terry drunk, Robert sober. Robert smiled
bashfully as Terry leaned in to him, Gerry Rafferty’s “Baker Street” blaring
from the trees. It looked as if Terry was confiding something to Robert, who
just kept nodding and laughing nervously. Terry had a particular stance that
unambiguously suggested he was interested in Robert sexually: he was
obviously hitting on him, as any gay man would have, I realized, in the right
setting, and Robert was trying to react as any polite and amiable straight dude
in a similar circumstance: I’m tolerating this with good humor but it’s not
going to happen. I realized that I was awkwardly frozen in place and that I
had to continue down the staircase until I hit the lawn, but then I would have
nowhere I wanted to go.
As I began nearing Terry and Robert, Liz Schaffer walked up to her
husband and said something and I noticed that the guests by the pool had
started heading toward the white tent. Terry bowed charmingly to his wife
and excused himself from Robert, then bounded up to the house, probably to
tell the guests inside that dinner was being served. Liz said something to
Robert and he nodded and as she walked away she noticed me and just
smiled tightly without saying anything—again, this distant stance from Liz
was startling but not entirely unexpected, I reassured myself. Robert walked
up the lawn to where I was standing and wasn’t smiling anymore. In fact he
seemed mildly shaken by the conversation he’d just had with Terry. I
experienced a brief flash of satisfaction—and maybe it was the initial
flowering of the Valium as well—when I asked Robert, “What were you and
Terry talking about?”
Robert looked around, as if he was nervous about something. He
suddenly seemed vulnerable, for maybe the first time since I’d met him.
“Oh, he just wanted to know if I ever modeled,” Robert said, tossing it
off, casually, unsure of what he should admit to me. “Or if I wanted to, um,
act.”
“And what did you tell him?” I asked.
“Bret, come on,” Robert said, as if we had an understanding about
something secret.
“What?” I shrugged, pretending to be innocent.
“I didn’t know he was Debbie’s dad. I’d never met him. I thought he was
just some random dude.” Robert said this conspiratorially and leaned in. “He
wanted to meet me for a drink at the Beverly Hills Hotel tomorrow.”
“And are you going to?” I asked casually, but the light flicker of dread
threatened to return.
“No, I had to pass on that,” Robert said, looking at me strangely. “I’m…
not really interested.”
“Not interested in what?” I pressed.
“I’m not interested in having a drink at the Polo Lounge with Terry
Schaffer,” Robert said, amused. “For many reasons, Bret.”
“Well, it wouldn’t be in the Polo Lounge anyway,” I murmured.
“Whatever,” he said, looking around for Susan. “It doesn’t matter. I’m
not interested.”
“Why not?” I asked, curiously. “He’s an important guy. He can make
you a stah.”
“Are you fucking with me?” Robert asked, his almond eyes tinged with
alertness and worry. “What are you asking me?”
“I’m just curious why you won’t meet Terry Schaffer for a drink at the
Beverly Hills Hotel.” The Valium was beginning to create a barrier—and
once behind it I didn’t care anymore.
Robert looked at me, pissed, and then said, “How about because he’s
scary.”
“Ooh, scary Terry,” I said, pretending to shiver. And then: “Why is he so
scary?” I asked. “Because he hit on you?”
Robert seemed surprised I said this out loud. He blushed. He whispered,
confused, leaning toward me again, “Debbie’s dad is gay, right?”
“I guess you didn’t know this,” I said. “Yeah, Terry’s into guys.”
“So he thought I was going to have sex with him just because he’s gay,”
Robert said flatly. “Is he out of his mind?” And then, looking at me as if
trying to figure something out, said, “You’re fucking with me.”
“He’s just high,” I said, realizing how relaxed the Valium was making
me. “He attacked me in the bathroom tonight.” I shrugged. Robert looked at
me horrified.
“And you let him?” Robert asked, appalled. “You didn’t do anything?”
“I think you’re overreacting,” I said. “I think you can take care of
yourself.”
“He’s Debbie’s dad, Bret,” Robert said.
“Yes, he is,” I said. “And I’m not telling Debbie it happened.”
“He touched me,” Robert said, staring. “He touched me right here on the
lawn.”
“Yeah, Terry does things like that,” I said coolly.
“You seem okay with it,” Robert said, still semi-stunned.
“You get used to it,” I said.
“He’s a freak,” Robert said quietly. “It’s not acceptable. You don’t just
grope your daughter’s friends at a fucking party.”
The Valium momentarily vanished and I wanted to scream at him about
all the unacceptable things Robert had done since he’d come into our lives
and the accusations made against him in Chicago. His reaction about Terry
was disgusting, especially compared with the horror I imagined he had
created and was still causing, but the Valium ultimately wouldn’t let me—I
became placid. I also found what I saw as Robert’s overreaction to Terry’s
advances faintly homophobic, but, then, I thought, I wasn’t a straight guy,
and I suddenly remembered how offended I’d been by the idea of Liz
Schaffer hitting on me drunkenly last year and momentarily connected to
Robert’s supposed outrage. I saw Susan and Debbie walking up the lawn to
where we were standing. “Welcome to L.A.,” was all I said.
“You really think it’s okay?” Robert said, again quietly. “Or are you
playing your little game now? Let’s see how many buttons I can push until
someone reacts.”
“I think you’ll survive,” I said in a low voice. “I think you’re a big boy.”
Robert said, “That’s really fucked up.”
“Fucked up is relative,” I said, turning to him.
—
“WHAT’S FUCKED UP?” Susan asked as she leaned in to Robert
suggestively, buzzed enough not to care how it looked in front of me.
He had been staring at me hard as if he was being challenged and didn’t
like it. But Susan’s presence had a calming effect, and when Debbie wrapped
her arm around my waist, he smiled at Susan and said, “This party is so crazy
it’s fucked up,” as if this was what Robert and I had been talking about and
not Terry Schaffer hitting on him and groping his dick. Behind us guests
were slowly walking down from the house and toward the white tent, which
lightly billowed in the warm wind. The girls admitted they weren’t hungry
and suggested we go inside. I shrugged why not and Robert seemed confused
at first as to why we were climbing the stairs up to Debbie’s room instead of
joining the guests for dinner, and then realized why as Debbie locked the
door behind us and sat on the bed and opened the second drawer of the
nightstand. Susan sat next to Debbie as she started pouring one of the packets
filled with cocaine onto the hand mirror. I slumped in a pink armchair across
the room and studied Robert as he watched Debbie cutting the pile into lines.
Robert shifted uncomfortably, his hands in his pockets, as if he was waiting
impatiently for the girls to quickly complete this task so we could get to the
tent for dinner. But it also seemed that the appearance of the cocaine was
activating something in him that he didn’t want to confront. A sudden
scratching at the door overly startled him. Billie barked from behind it.
“Babe, can you let him in?” Susan asked.
I just smiled at the way Susan called him babe—the Valium had fully
kicked in, everything was really so ridiculous behind the barrier: the party,
Matt’s death, the cocaine, Terry groping Robert, Terry on his knees in the
bathroom downstairs, the Trawler’s madness, the disappearing girls—all of
it. The casual use of “babe” was another confirmation of what was
happening, a beam of light in a darkened cave where other beams of light
were suddenly appearing, illuminating the truth. Robert turned and opened
the door and the golden retriever immediately padded over to Debbie, who
ignored the dog as she kept cutting lines. Susan absently petted Billie and
then noted Robert’s shifting stance—he seemed uncomfortable around the
dog and he made no move to interact with it or pet the perpetually grinning
head. In fact it seemed as if he was looking at the animal with a vague disdain
—the dog seemed to distract and even repel him. Debbie had to remind
Robert to reclose the door and then lock it, which he did. I noticed there was
an expression on his face as he watched Debbie cutting the lines that
indicated he was making a decision about something: he didn’t want to be in
the room anymore.
“Are you okay?” Susan noticed this as well. “I’m just doing a line,
nothing major,” she reassured him.
“Yeah, I know,” Robert said. “But…” He made a gesture toward the
door he had just closed and locked. “I’m going to get something to eat, I
guess.”
“Okay,” Susan said. “We’ll be down soon.”
Robert nodded and then Susan said, “You’re not mad, are you?”
“No, babe, no,” he said. “Being around it just makes me a little
uncomfortable, that’s all,” he admitted and then paused. “I’m just hungry. I
want you to have a good time.”
“Could you go out the other way?” Debbie asked, pointing to the door
that led to the second-story landing and the staircase that would take Robert
to the foyer. If he had left through the door that led to the outside staircase
Debbie and Susan could have been clearly visible to any of the guests
walking along the lawn toward the tent.
“Oh, yeah, sure,” Robert said crossing the room, and I watched as he
carefully opened the door and then entered the darkened hallway, giving me a
quick smile before closing it behind him, and I wondered what the smile
meant—so many things, I imagined, floating. He won, Thom lost, I was
nowhere. It was silent in the room as Debbie leaned over and sniffed the first
line off the mirror, and moved aside so Susan could do the next. Debbie
looked over at me, the cocaine hitting, and I just offered a Valium grin and
shook my head at nothing. She gestured at the mirror lined with coke. “I’m
okay,” I said. Susan did another line and then so did Debbie, and I hadn’t
noticed there was an opened bottle of Dom Pérignon until Debbie was
pouring it into the flutes they’d carried with them back to the room, and then
Debbie lit a cigarette and opened the window above her bed, blowing the
smoke outside. Susan wanted a drag and inhaled deeply on the clove Debbie
handed her. I looked over at the posters again as Susan walked over to the
stereo and lifted the needle and placed it on the record that was already on the
turntable. And it was something I remembered from my childhood,
something my parents used to play, an up-tempo ballad on an eight-track:
“Last Night I Didn’t Get to Sleep at All” and then I shifted in the armchair
and looked at Susan, who had stood up and was swaying to the song.
“Thom gets back tomorrow,” I said. “What are you going to do?”
“Actually Thom gets back Monday night,” Susan said dreamily. “He’s
staying an extra day.” She paused, swayed. “Lionel got tickets to a football
game.” She paused again and kept swaying to the music. “At Giants
Stadium,” she enunciated. “The Giants are playing the Jets,” she said in a
lightly sardonic tone as if the sport was a joke and the names of the teams
were punch lines. She was making fun of something Thom took seriously
enough to stay an extra day so he could go to the game, and this was a tone
and an angle I had never heard from her before and it was another step away
from Thom and their past. But I was remarkably relaxed as I watched Susan
take the cigarette from Debbie, who walked past me to look through her
records as the song continued playing. “The sleeping pill I took was just a
waste of time,” the woman sang. Susan moved back to the window and
exhaled smoke through it.
“So Thom gets back to school on Tuesday,” I said. “What are you going
to do?”
“What are you going to do?” she asked back lightly.
“You told him,” I said. “You told Robert.”
“Told him what?” Susan asked, waving another stream of smoke into the
night air. She looked over at me as if locating my presence in a haze.
“You’re staying with him in Century City,” I said quietly. “He let me
know that.”
“I might,” Susan said, unfazed. “But I might not.”
“But it’s an option,” I said. “Or that’s what Robert told me.”
“Oh, did he?” she asked, now mildly amused. The numbness activated
by the cocaine was Susan at her most distant. None of what I said seemed to
bother her at all, and this suggested that she had a plan for dealing with Thom
she wasn’t telling anyone—it would have been awful to be in her presence if
I hadn’t been lightly stoned on the vodka and Valium, but since I was numb
none of this particularly bothered me in that moment.
“He told me this was just between him and me,” I said. “You going to
Century City tonight.” I paused. “So you told him. And I asked you not to.”
“I didn’t tell him anything,” she said. “I don’t know what you’re talking
about.”
“You didn’t keep your promise,” I said. “The promise I asked you to
make in Palm Springs.”
“That’s not true,” she sighed. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,”
she said again.
I didn’t say anything. I was just listening to the music. I couldn’t close
my eyes ’cause you were on my mind…and I realized, embarrassingly, the
song was in that moment about my feelings for Thom and that Susan didn’t
hear it that way at all: in fact she wasn’t even thinking about Thom Wright
anymore. She said something in the break between when the song ended and
a new one began. I hadn’t heard her and asked Susan to repeat what she’d
just said.
“Do you really care?” she asked.
“Susan,” I said, and then I said her name again.
Susan traced her finger over the mirror and rubbed the residue of coke
along her gums, and then took another drag off the cigarette, lost in the drug
and champagne and the promise of romance, a night with Robert Mallory at
the penthouse in Century City. One song ended and another one began: it was
the same group, another single from my childhood, “Up, Up and Away,” and
I was wondering why Debbie was playing this retro music and why she
hadn’t entered into our conversation, and helped steer it from the druggy
evasions of Susan, and just allowed it to play out between us instead. My
eyes glanced at the poster of the black faces again and I sat up a little,
suddenly interested in the name of the band in yellow at the top of the
poster’s edge—it was hard to see from where I was sitting. I couldn’t
remember the name of the group, and when I peered closely at it they were
whom I thought—the 5th Dimension—and the poster was for Their Greatest
Hits and I wondered why this poster was pinned up in Debbie’s room now
and why she was listening to them.
I was on the verge of asking her about the poster when we were jolted by
the screaming that was suddenly coming from outside Debbie’s bedroom
door.
—
THE SCREAMS weren’t celebratory or joyous but shocked and anguished
and loud enough to burst through the walls of Debbie’s room and over the
music we were listening to. Billie started barking furiously and dashed to the
door and pawed at it, whimpering, desperately looking over at Debbie, who
was kneeling by her record collection and then stood up, frozen, confused,
looking at the door behind which the screams were coming from, and Susan’s
coy numbness was immediately replaced with a newfound concern and she
crushed the cigarette out and was the first of us to walk over and open the
door, with Billie scrambling past her and down the darkened hallway. There
existed only one person screaming now—the chorus of screams had subsided
and there was just a soundtrack of worried voices—and the one scream had
become a kind of bellowing, and it was guttural and male and I remember
Jigsaw singing “Sky High” suddenly being turned off mid-verse as Susan,
Debbie and I quickly walked to the landing on the second floor, which was
flickering with candlelight and where guests were gathered around the railing
looking down onto the foyer—a frantic murmuring was rising toward us from
below, where the screaming was coming from, and then the crystal chandelier
blasted light across the landing, revealing the grand curving staircase and the
white-tiled foyer and that’s when Debbie pushed between where Susan and
me were standing and looked down at Terry Schaffer lying in the middle of
the foyer, on his back, red-faced and screaming, the veins bulging in his neck.
Terry’s right leg was bent up beside him so that his foot touched his
torso—it was such an unnatural angle that it looked almost cartoonish, unreal,
and then I noticed the blood quickly pooling beside the bent leg and realized
that Steven Reinhardt was kneeling next to Terry below the bright light, and
there were two surfer valets trying to calm Terry down, an array of horrified
guests standing in the background. Steven had carefully pulled up the right
leg of Terry’s slacks, which revealed a large bone—it was the snapped midtibia—piercing through the skin of his right shin, and this was where the
blood was both spraying and then simply gushing out across the floor of the
foyer, and Debbie started crying and put her hands over her ears and fell to
her knees. Susan just stood at the railing stunned and I kept staring at the
bone. And then Terry stopped screaming, his face crimson and the veins in
his neck still bulging absurdly, and suddenly he looked surprised as he
vomited onto the foyer—it just shot out of his mouth—and then he vomited
again and fainted. I was realizing that Terry had fallen from the second story
landing and crashed onto the tiled floor at an angle that rendered this injury
possible. Billie was frantically sniffing around Terry and then started
nervously lapping up the vomit until the two surfers pushed the dog away and
someone led it into the kitchen. I looked up across to the other side of the
landing and there wasn’t anyone standing at the railing looking down from
where Terry had fallen. The landing was empty.
—
LIZ SCHAFFER had pushed through the crowd and it took a moment for her
to realize what had happened: her husband was lying unconscious, a
widening pool of blood spreading from his leg, the glass tumbler Terry was
holding when he fell shattered next to him. Liz was drunk and, instead of
instinctively kneeling down with Steven and the surfers to aid her husband,
just started yelling at Terry’s prone body on the floor, his head next to a spray
of vomit. “What did you do?” she yelled. “This is just great! What in the fuck
did you do, you stupid fucking bastard! Why do you ruin everything, you
fucking stupid bastard? You fucking stupid fag bastard!” And then she
gasped and started weeping when she saw the extent of the wound and the
bone sticking half out of the shin and the calf and dramatically collapsed as
guests cried out surprised. Two men carried Liz into the living room, where
we heard her quickly regain consciousness and start yelling angrily again
while weeping about why Terry was such a mess. “He thinks I have a
problem! He’s a fucking cokehead! He’s a cocksucker!” she screamed.
Debbie had started walking slowly down the curving staircase and for
some reason she kept her ears covered with her hands as she wept and made
it a few feet before getting to where Steven and two of the surfers were now
trying to tie a tourniquet made from Terry’s belt around the bleeding wound,
and then Steven searched Terry’s pockets and found the vial of coke and
slipped it into his own jeans. Steven had already made a number of fast
emergency phone calls and suddenly so many sirens pierced the night air
coming up Stone Canyon. Bel Air Security and the Los Angeles Police
Department and an ambulance dispatched from the UCLA Medical Center
arrived almost simultaneously, all within minutes after Terry had fallen, and
their vehicles crowded the circular driveway. The sirens abruptly stopped and
the red and blue lights of the police cars swirled through the diamondpatterned windows on the second-story landing where Susan and I still stood.
Terry was lifted onto a stretcher and quickly loaded into the ambulance and
then Steven drove Liz and Debbie to the Medical Center in Westwood. No
one really knew what to do in the minutes after they left: the music had
stopped, the lights had been turned on all over the house, there was a stunned
and confused silence hanging everywhere. People started leaving and the
valets began pulling their cars forward after the ambulance and the LAPD
and the host and the hostess had all left—there was no one to get any
instructions from about where to go or what to do. Paul was mopping up the
blood and the vomit and Maria, the Schaffers’ housekeeper, was helping him.
—
SUSAN AND I realized there were still people down by the tent and that’s
where Robert probably was but in fact he was already walking up the lawn to
the house when we met him, looking anxious and asking what happened, and
Susan told him that Terry had fallen from the upstairs landing and broken his
leg and was just taken to the hospital and Robert seemed confused and didn’t
understand what we were talking about—“Terry fell? He broke his leg? It
was an accident? Is he okay?”—and then Susan, who had been so calm,
suddenly burst into tears and hugged Robert and he hugged her back, his face
over her shoulder, averting his eyes from mine. I stared for a moment at
Susan convulsing against Robert and then looked away: the guests who had
heard the sirens were murmuring worriedly to each other as they wandered
out of the tent. Susan quickly composed herself and pulled back from Robert,
wiping her face with the back of her hand, and muttered that she just wanted
to get out of there, the party was over, it was time to leave. “Bret?” she said,
as if I needed to confirm this. “Yeah, you’re right,” I said. “Let’s just go
home.”
And then the three of us were walking back to the house and through the
foyer, which had now been completely cleaned, and a few stunned guests
were still standing around sobering up. Susan and Robert waited until the
valet brought my car—Susan had parked her BMW in one of the spaces in
the garage when she arrived earlier that afternoon and the keys were in it.
When the 450SL pulled up I hugged Susan and then, surprisingly, Robert and
I hugged—but it was loose, two dudes, nothing tight—and I was thankful that
they’d waited with me, because there was no way I could bear to watch
Robert get into Susan’s BMW, which he would probably be driving—he was
sober and she was upset and coked up—back to the condo in Century City,
where he’d spend the night comforting her with his tongue, his fingers, his
cock. I drove back to the empty house on Mulholland and took another one of
Debbie’s Valiums and watched Saturday Night Live alone in my bedroom.
Donald Pleasence, who played Dr. Loomis in Halloween, was hosting and the
musical guest was Fear but I couldn’t concentrate on any of the skits because
I was behind the barrier, calmly thinking about not only a woman falling to
her death from the second-story landing in a townhouse in Chicago but also
the meaning of a poster in Debbie Schaffer’s bedroom pinned to a wall in the
mansion on Stone Canyon.
25
I NEEDED TO ask Debbie where she found the 5th Dimension poster.
This was one of three things that preoccupied me on that Sunday, along
with the image of Terry’s shattered leg and Carol Mallory falling off a similar
landing when she crashed to her death in a Chicago townhouse in the spring
of 1980. In my narrative Robert also pushed Terry off the landing in Stone
Canyon after he left Debbie’s bedroom and I imagined Terry had been in the
house telling everyone dinner was being served and ran into Robert on the
landing and hit on him again, groped his dick, tried to kiss him, the two of
them just silhouettes in the darkness on the landing, so no one saw what
happened. Robert escaped through the hallway on the other side of the
landing, parallel to the one that led to Debbie’s bedroom, which took Robert
to the back of the house and down a stairwell that led to the maid’s room and
then through the kitchen and outside to the tent—perhaps completely
unnoticed. There was no way to prove this on that Sunday afternoon and I
realized we’d have to hear from Terry Schaffer as to whether some version of
this happened or not, though I also realized Terry might never admit it:
coming on to an underage kid, who pushed away from his advances, resulting
in the injury he sustained when he fell over the railing. Because Abigail
Mallory mentioned to me that this was exactly how Robert’s mother, her
sister-in-law, died, I made this connection and though it was tenuous I was
haunted by it. And since I felt so alone that day it became a friend.
—
I WAS IN THE kitchen when I heard the phone from my bedroom ringing
and I walked down the hallway and reached for the receiver before the
answering machine clicked on. It was Debbie. She seemed surprised that I
picked up. “I knew it was going to be you,” I said softly, and then asked if
she had slept. “Yeah, a little,” she said, and then proceeded to tell me what
happened at the hospital after she and Liz and Steven Reinhardt arrived at
UCLA Medical Center, where her father had already disappeared into the
ER’s operating room, and how Debbie and Liz became entangled in a
screaming match in the fluorescent-lit waiting area, each blaming the other
for Terry’s fuckups. Liz was drunk and flailing angrily as Debbie screamed
back in tears and began coming down from the cocaine while Liz kept
referring to me as “that boyfriend of yours” until Steven—talking to the
emergency physician and Terry’s own personal doctor, who had driven over
from Brentwood—interrupted the two women because he was told by
members of the staff it would be a good idea to take Liz and Debbie back to
Bel Air, but not before Liz demanded a tranquilizer and after one was
administered wept in the car as Steven drove them to Stone Canyon, where
he basically carried Liz to her bedroom and Debbie cried herself in and out of
sleep, exhausted, until she finally took something and was knocked out until
two in the afternoon.
“I thought my mother liked you,” Debbie said. “I had no idea what she
was referring to.” I calmly explained what I’d seen on the Sunday before
Labor Day in the living room, her mom drunk and naked, and Debbie said,
“Maybe that’s it. She’s so erratic.” She asked me why I hadn’t waited for her
at the house last night and I told her I had no idea if she was coming back or
not, and what could I have done anyway? Debbie only sighed and murmured,
“I guess.” I asked about Terry and what actually happened. Did he say
anything? Does anyone know? No, she said. Steven told her that Terry was
under sedation and that he’d be at UCLA for a few days and then transferred
to Cedars, where he’d have to undergo a number of operations—the damage
was so bad that Terry wouldn’t be able to get around on crutches for a week
and Debbie and Liz couldn’t see or talk to him until tomorrow. There was so
much blood, Debbie finally murmured.
“I need to see you. I need to be with you.” She paused, and then asked,
“Why didn’t you leave any messages when you called?”
I asked her what she meant. And she explained that there were six empty
messages on her answering machine when she woke—just silence and then a
hang up. “Wasn’t that you?”
I didn’t know what to say. I hadn’t called. I didn’t want to scare her and
explain over the phone who I thought the calls were coming from. I would
tell her when I saw her. “Oh yeah,” I said. “I wanted to see how you were.” I
found myself blushing at the lie. “But you never picked up so I just…” I
trailed off.
“I need to see you,” she said again.
“Yes, yeah, of course,” I said. “Do you want to come over?”
“Yeah,” she said. “I’ve got to get out of here. I don’t want to be around
when Liz wakes up.”
“I’ll see you soon” was all I said.
—
SHE ARRIVED AROUND FOUR and we tried to have sex but I couldn’t get
hard and Debbie seemed aroused in only a desultory way and so I went down
on her—I had, by the time I started having sex with Debbie, watched enough
straight porn to kind of know what to do and I always managed to make
Debbie have an orgasm. After its release she cried and I held her and then we
walked to the kitchen, where she found a bottle of white wine in the back of
the refrigerator and opened it. She poured herself a glass of the Chardonnay
and I made sure Shingy had enough food and then we moved silently back to
my room and lay on the bed while I used the remote to try and find
something to watch on TV. It was night by now and through the large bay
window I could see the ground lamps in the yard lit up by the automatic
timer. The sound on the television was low and I finally asked, very quietly,
“How long have you known about Susan and Robert?”
“I don’t know,” she murmured, resting against me, in one of the Camp
Beverly Hills T-shirts she favored that year and a simple pair of pink
underwear. “I guess Susan mentioned him the first day,” she said. “After
school. When we were in Fiorucci’s. That she liked him. That he was cute.”
She paused and just stared at the TV screen. Electrifying, I remembered
Susan saying. “And then it happened.” She paused again. “It just happened.
Somewhere along the line it happened. She was moving away from Thom.”
She took a sip of wine and I suddenly flashed on Debbie becoming a drunken
Liz in five years. I didn’t say anything—I just kept my eyes fixed on the
screen, concentrating on surfing the channels, finding something we could
watch. I didn’t know what to say—I wanted to tell her who the phone calls
were coming from but I wasn’t ready yet.
“I knew you were in Palm Springs,” Debbie said softly.
I swallowed and finally felt that wave of dread I had known was out
there to sweep away the numbness and it did, my relentless companion
during that fall.
“Susan told me,” Debbie said, and then, “It doesn’t matter.”
“No,” I finally said. “I guess it doesn’t.”
“I was going to confront you at school, on that Monday,” she said. “But
it doesn’t matter.”
And what more did I need to know about Susan Reynolds and Robert
Mallory? It was happening and it had nothing to do with me—I wasn’t
connected to the relationship that had formed itself among us during that first
semester of our senior year. Debbie didn’t say anything else, didn’t offer any
details or snatches of conversations between the two girls about the new boy,
nothing. And though I might have thought I had questions, in the end I really
didn’t: there was nothing else I wanted to know. It would play itself out and
we’d have to deal with it. Something else was more compelling to me in that
moment.
“Can I ask you a question?” I said.
She nodded once, curled against me, staring at the TV screen.
“Where did you get that poster?” I asked. “The one for the 5th
Dimension?”
“It was on the table in the foyer where all the mail was,” Debbie said.
I paused and felt suddenly nauseous. The hand holding the remote had
begun to tremble and I almost lowered it onto my lap.
“I think it was from my dad,” she said vacantly. “I know that Susan likes
them.” She paused and sipped the wine. “It’s kind of a cool poster.”
“When did you find it?” I managed to ask.
“Sometime last week,” she said in the same vague way. “I get free
posters all the time. My dad gets stuff. Liz.” She kept staring at the screen but
she wasn’t looking at anything specifically. She was too far away from me.
She wasn’t paying close enough attention. She didn’t know anything. She
hadn’t been following the narrative. She knew nothing about the clues. This
applied to who Debbie thought I was as well.
“You’re playing a game, right?” I asked. I was trembling as if the
temperature in the room had suddenly plummeted.
“What kind of game?” she asked tonelessly.
“Debbie,” I started but then didn’t know what to say. Debbie and Susan
knew nothing about the Trawler, they hadn’t been following his story, they
didn’t know the warning signs. I was stalled. “It’s just…”
“It’s just what?” she asked in a completely uninterested way.
“The Trawler,” I managed in a weak voice.
“The Trawler—what is that?” she asked.
“The girls that have been getting killed…” I started.
“I don’t really follow the news,” she said. “What does that have to do
with anything?”
“It leaves posters,” I said as evenly as possible. “It leaves…posters for
people. There’s a…sequence.”
I felt Debbie shift beside me as she turned her head to look at my face.
“Sometimes a poster is just a poster, Bret,” she said. “You’re scaring
me.”
“Maybe you should be scared,” I said quietly.
“No, not that. You are scaring me,” she clarified. “Talking like this. And
you’ve been scaring Susan as well. She told me that you thought Robert was
somehow connected to what happened to Matt.”
My eyes had dropped from the TV to the drawer with the Maxell cassette
in it. And for a moment I thought I was going to stand up and play the tape
for her at the highest volume possible so she could hear every terrible moan
and shriek, but then decided not to—I couldn’t listen to it again. It was too
horrible. And why did I have it? And why was Matt being questioned about
having sex with a man? What man? Who was the ghoul talking about? I had
already realized: it was me.
“And you’ve been…receiving phone calls,” I said quietly as if I hadn’t
heard her. “That’s part of the pattern as well…” Silence.
“I’m getting more wine,” she finally muttered, pushing up off the bed.
I waited a beat and then opened the nightstand drawer and took one of
the Valiums: it would work, I would be able to relax again, I would drift off
into the nowhere zone, become numb and erase the anxiety. Debbie came
back and stood at the edge of the bed. I looked up at her innocently but I also
wanted to convey my fear. “I’m concerned…” she started and let the words
hang there.
“About what?”
“About you,” she said. She had refilled the wine glass and took a
swallow.
“I’m concerned about…you,” I said, trying to keep my voice from
quaking.
“Well, we’re a couple,” she said. “We should be concerned about each
other.”
In any other scene this would have deeply irritated me—a reminder that
we actually weren’t a couple and that Debbie only thought we were and that
this was ultimately my fault: I had helped create the illusion that she was
buying into.
“I know things that you don’t,” I said. I felt I was spacing out and that no
matter what I managed to explain it wouldn’t matter—it would, in fact,
become part of a larger concern she’d have about me.
“You know things about a serial killer,” Debbie said. “And you know
things that connect Robert to Matt Kellner’s death. Is this what you know?”
“Yes, I think so,” I said in a faraway voice.
“Have you ever thought about talking to someone?” she asked. She sat
down on the edge of the bed.
“I’m talking to…you,” I said, confused. “Do you mean the police?”
“No, I meant a professional,” she said gently.
Something got activated. “What do you mean?” I asked.
“I mean someone to talk to about these…concerns.” She let the sentence
hang there. “Someone you could talk to about…these fears.”
“You mean a shrink,” I said hollowly.
“Yes,” Debbie said. “A psychiatrist or a psychologist—”
“You don’t know anything,” I said. “And I do.”
“I think…you twist things,” she said. “I think you don’t like Robert.”
“Debbie, if you only knew you wouldn’t—”
“And I understand that,” she said. “You’re close to Thom—”
“We’re all close to Thom!” I said loudly. The fear was ratcheted up.
She wasn’t listening. “But that doesn’t mean Robert’s out there
abducting girls and that he had anything to do with Matt—”
“There’s a time line,” I stressed quietly, closing my eyes. “There’s a time
line, Deborah. And he’s dangerous. He’s a liar and he’s dangerous.” I paused.
“I’m worried he’s going to do something to Susan.”
She didn’t say anything. She looked at the wineglass she was holding.
And I realized: she was reconsidering my sanity, and suddenly it all felt
hopeless as I became spacier—I was almost behind the barrier. I slid down
until I was prone on the bed, my eyes shut tightly; a maddening helplessness I
couldn’t control was washing over everything. I wanted to explain the time
line to her but something was holding me back. “Okay, okay,” I finally said.
“I understand.”
“What do you understand?” she asked. She was staring, expecting me to
relinquish my narrative and conform to hers. I was already performing this to
a degree and so it ultimately wasn’t difficult to keep moving through the
pantomime I’d built for us. I told myself, vaguely, that I would figure it out,
whatever that meant, I had no idea, everything was formless, just air. “I’m
sorry” is all I said. “I’m tired.” I paused. “I’m sorry,” I said again.
“You’re crying,” she said. “Why are you crying?”
I touched my face. I hadn’t realized my cheeks were wet. And then I
burst into a massive sob. I covered my face with my hands as I started
convulsing on the bed, completely overwhelmed.
“Baby, baby,” Debbie said. I heard her put the wineglass down on the
nightstand and then the weight of the bed shifted as she leaned in to me and
tried to gently take one of the hands off my face. The sobbing was so intense
I sounded like an animal. And then I forced it to stop and I turned away from
her, folding into myself, reaching for a Kleenex and wiping my face and then
blowing my nose. I was lightly panting from the force of the tears—they had
come from fear, from the stress of being afraid all the time, along with the
relief that the Valium was bringing me. She had wrapped her legs around
mine and was running her hand through my hair, softly telling me everything
was going to be all right, and I fell asleep in my tennis shorts and T-shirt and
the Valium kept me unconscious until Debbie woke me at seven-thirty the
next morning by gently kissing my lips, reminding me I was going to be late
for school. She was dressed—she’d been up since seven and fed Shingy and
let him out and took a dip in the pool—and Rosa had just arrived, earlier than
usual, and Debbie said that she had to get back home to change into her
Buckley uniform and that if she didn’t see me beneath the bell tower before
nine then we’d meet by the lockers after first period. I nodded and watched
her walk out of the room and down the hall. I could hear her speaking quiet
Spanish to Rosa and then the clattering of Shingy’s paws as he followed
Debbie to the front door, and then she was gone.
26
I ARRIVED AT BUCKLEY LATE on that Monday in November, after first
period began, and pulled the 450SL into a space in the senior parking lot and
then made my way under the bell tower and headed to the administration
building, fingering the Maxell cassette that was in the pocket of my blazer.
The hush in the office was occasionally interrupted by a phone ringing and
the sporadic clicking of an electric typewriter as I waited until one of the
secretaries, Mrs. Davies, hung up the phone and I told her I needed to talk to
Dr. Croft. Concerned, she asked me if I had an appointment and I told her no,
I didn’t. She made a questioning face and then looked across a piece of paper
on a clipboard and asked, “What is this about, Bret?” and I said, “It’s just
very important that I speak to him.” She stared at me. “It’s private,” I said
brusquely. “It’s personal.” Mrs. Davies lifted the phone, even though I could
see the entrance to Croft’s office from where I stood and the door was open
—I could have just bypassed her and walked in, but the formalities at
Buckley never would have allowed me to do that even as a senior and despite
all the perks that came with being a member of the twelfth grade. I heard the
phone ring and then Croft picking up but I didn’t hear what she quietly said
as I paced away from her desk, my eyes scanning past a giant vase of
stargazer lilies, the LeRoy Neiman painting, the grandfather clock that
announced it was nine-fifteen, all the while fingering the cassette tape in the
pocket of my jacket. Croft actually came out of his office—he was dressed in
a suit and tie and looking at me curiously. “Why aren’t you in class, Bret?”
he asked. I muttered, “I need to talk to you. It’s very important.” Croft must
have noticed how upset I looked even though I’d been careful putting myself
together that morning so there could be less of an excuse to not believe what I
was about to tell him: the tie wasn’t loosened, I was wearing a regulation
white shirt, not something Polo or Armani, I shaved, my hair was neatly
brushed, I was wearing the traditional penny loafers and not Topsiders. I
wanted to look like a model student. Croft said, “Well, come in.”
—
I FOLLOWED HIM into the office. It was Buckley-elegant: the sleek and
uncluttered mahogany desk, two chairs across from it, a rolled-arm sofa, with
identical floral pattern upholstery, behind the chairs and flanked by floor
lamps, a coffee table with a black-and-white chess set laid out, lush ferns
bordering the sides of a wide window offering a view of two walkways
leading to the first rows of stucco bungalows that led into the rest of the
school, in one of which was being taught a class I should have been in—
Mr. Robbins, American Fiction—and where I should have been sitting next
to Susan Reynolds and talking about the symbolism in Slaughterhouse Five
while I tried not to look at Ryan Vaughn. The only institutional touch in
Croft’s office was the panels of fluorescent lights above us, which I glanced
at nervously as Croft waved me in, positioning himself in the leather swivel
chair behind his desk. I asked him if I could close the door and he paused
before he nodded, as if realizing he didn’t want to agitate any further an
already nervous student.
I had known Croft for three years by that point—he first arrived in the
fall of 1978—but I had no idea where he was from, where he had worked
before, what his interests were, why we referred to him as Dr. He was goodlooking, no older than forty, and there was something masculine about him
that I vaguely responded to: brown wavy hair and a beard that accentuated a
pair of thick lips, and his eyes were almond shaped and there was something
youthful about his overall demeanor. He was the opposite of the bureaucratic
disciplinarian that the much older Headmaster Walters embodied—someone
more invested in the original idea of the Buckley tradition and its principles.
Croft was casual with the students, and certainly looser then the last
principal, a chain-smoking elfin Frenchman who wore silvery YSL suits and
seemed to have an amusing disdain for the job as well as the students he’d
been hired to preside over—there was something about Mr. Renaud that
suggested he was better than Buckley and the job was somehow beneath him.
Croft was younger and the students liked him, he had a friendly vibe—there
were no nasally impressions or gross rumors connected to him, unlike with
Renaud; he was approachable, and I’m sure there were female students who
found him attractive. I suppose I knew he was married but I didn’t know if he
had any children, and I realized, as I sat in his office on that first Monday of
November, that Dr. Croft was a blank, because he was an adult, and therefore
was someone I didn’t quite know yet—I was just beginning to enter that
world. He actually knew far more about me than I knew about him. For
myself, in that moment, he was just the most easily accessible authority
figure available, and I needed to talk to someone.
—
CROFT REACHED INTO a drawer and pulled out a folder—I didn’t know it
was mine at first—and opened it, scanned a few pages he lifted before saying
anything. Croft looked up at me and asked quizzically, as if he also already
knew the answer, “Did you retake the SATs last week?” I looked at him,
surprised that this was what he thought I wanted to talk about or that he even
knew this. “No, I…rescheduled them,” I said, haltingly. He sighed, a little
disappointed, and then said, looking through the file, “Mrs. Zimmerman says
you made and then canceled a number of appointments with her—”
“It was only two,” I interrupted Croft. In that moment I thought I was
going to explode with frustration. I tried not writhing in the chair. “I’ll make
another appointment with her but I’m not here to talk about that.” I made a
nervous gesture with my hand. “About colleges and SATs.” I glanced over at
the wide window and even though no one would be able to clearly make us
out, because it was tinted green, I still felt exposed sitting there. The other
hand was in my pocket, the fingertips pressing against the cassette tape.
“Okay,” Croft said, leaning back in his chair. “So what’s up?”
I immediately started talking. “I think there’s something wrong with one
of the students here,” I said calmly but with emphasis. “Robert Mallory. I
know all about the developmental center he was in before he came here and
the suicide attempt, the overdose, and I talked to his aunt and she’s concerned
about him as well and I think he had something to do with Matt Kellner’s
death.” I was looking at Croft directly when I said this to underscore the
seriousness of the situation—my eyes didn’t dart nervously around the room,
I wasn’t fidgeting or crossing and recrossing my legs, I was completely still.
Croft was just staring at me, his expression unchanged even though I sensed
he was disturbed that this was what I wanted to talk about. But I knew that
our parents paid far too much tuition for Croft to dismiss me or any other
student immediately and that his job involved listening to the students no
matter how outlandish or lost or entitled they sounded.
Croft continued to stare at me blankly; there was a long pause in which
he wondered which direction to go. This gave me hope but it also disturbed
me. I breathed in.
“Are you okay, Bret?” he finally asked.
“Yes, yes,” I said. “I am.” I realized something. “No, I’m not on drugs.
I’m not high. If that’s what you’re thinking.”
“No, no.” He held up his hands, surprised. “I wasn’t thinking that—”
“Then why did you ask that?” I interrupted him.
“You just seem very agitated,” Dr. Croft said. “I’m a little concerned.”
“I’m fine, I’m fine,” I said. “I just need you to hear me out—”
“Hear you out about—” He was talking over me.
“I think Robert Mallory was involved with Matt’s death.”
“Yes, I heard you, um…” Croft considered this before saying, “But you
know that Matt Kellner’s death was ruled accidental—”
“But his parents don’t think that.” I cut him off. “Ronald Kellner doesn’t
think it was accidental at all. He thinks—”
“Well, Ronald Kellner is very upset, as he should be,” Croft interrupted
gently. “The pain of losing a child must be enormous and I’m not sure his
judgment is fully intact.”
It was silent in the office as Croft just stared back at me after he said this.
He had no interest in my file anymore. He closed the folder. He understood
now that the meeting I requested had nothing to do with any of the
information in the file: this wasn’t about academics or my SAT scores or
getting into the right college or whatever my GPA was.
“Did you see the autopsy report?” I asked quietly. “Did you know about
the bruises? Did you know there were bruises all over Matt’s body? And that
someone hit him with something? And that someone hit his forehead with a
hammer or something?”
“I did not see the autopsy report,” Croft said, then realized and asked,
surprised, “Did you?”
“Yes,” I nodded. “Yes, I saw it. Mr. Kellner showed it to me.” I stopped,
unsure if I should offer the following. “And I also saw photos. Of Matt. Of
what Mr. Kellner called the crime scene.” Silence. “It wasn’t accidental. It
didn’t look accidental.”
“Why would Ron Kellner do that?” Croft asked, more curious now than
surprised. “Why would he show you these things?”
“I went over to Matt’s house,” I explained as evenly as I could. “After he
died. I talked to Ronald. I wanted to know what happened to Matt. No one
knew anything. No one still knows anything. It’s like everyone just doesn’t
want to know that he was attacked.” I breathed in. My fingers kept pressing
down on the cassette tape in the pocket of the blazer.
Croft studied me and it seemed that he made a decision to treat me like
an adult: there was a moment when I felt the mood in the room change and I
rose to it, but it didn’t happen. “A student with a drug problem had a
psychotic break by abusing hallucinogens and then overdosing on Quaaludes
and then mutilated himself and drowned,” Croft said, very softly. “This is
not, as far as I know, a criminal investigation, even if Ronald Kellner wants
to make it one.” Croft paused and stared at me. “And besides, Buckley has
nothing to do with the death of Matt Kellner.” He paused again. “Matt didn’t
expire on school grounds. We have no connection to whatever happened, so
we are left out of the loop.”
I remember that word forty years later: loop. It sounded so casual, so
offhand. I immediately thought of a Froot Loop. The use of the word seemed
to diminish the seriousness of what I wanted to impart. Walking into the
administration building, I had felt in such command of the information that I
was going to lay out for Dr. Croft that I would end up controlling the
conversation. But that wasn’t happening, I realized, confused, trying to get
my narrative back on the track I wanted it to run on. In this respect it was
reminding me of the movie pitch I tried to sell Terry Schaffer in the
bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel and that he ultimately rejected as well.
“Okay, okay, that doesn’t matter…” I started. I blinked a couple of
times, breathed in and shook my head to let Croft register my frustration.
“Matt wasn’t a drug addict,” I said. “He smoked a ton of weed but he wasn’t
a drug addict and he never tripped on acid and he never took ’ludes and—”
Croft gently interrupted me again. “And we know that Matt told his
father he was going to see Robert Mallory before he disappeared and that
Ronald Kellner, in fact, talked to Robert, who denied that he ever saw Matt
that week.” Croft was staring at me. He said this to make sure I was aware of
the information as well, so that it should limit what I wanted to tell him next.
Croft even relayed this as a warning: that I needed to calm down and be
careful with whatever I wanted to reveal or else there would be no point to
having the meeting last any longer and he’d have to excuse me and suggest I
get back to class.
“Yes, I know that, too, Dr. Croft,” I said quickly. “But what if Robert
lied? What if Robert wasn’t telling the truth? I think he’s a liar. He lies all the
time. Why should we believe him about this? He was institutionalized. He
tried to commit suicide. He’s sick.”
For one brief moment I thought Croft became invested in what I was
saying when he asked me, “How do you think Robert was involved?”
The following came out in a rush: “I think, I think, that Matt went over to
Robert’s that weekend, and not the condo in Century City but a house on
Benedict Canyon, and I think Robert drugged him and I think he was the one
who drove him out to Crystal Cove in his Porsche and then proceeded to beat
the shit out of him and I think he was the one who drove Matt’s car back to
Haskell Avenue from Benedict, was the one who’d kept Matt high and strung
out for seven days—he gave him the hallucinogens, he fed him the
Quaaludes, it was torture, something he got off on—and then back in Encino
he slashed Matt’s arm open on that Friday night or early Saturday morning
after Crystal Cove and then hit him with something, I don’t know, a hammer
or something, and then dumped the body in the pool and staged it. I don’t
know why—I think it was Robert who was having a psychotic break. And
then he fucking killed the cat and…” I caught a breath, I sat back, I thought I
was going to start crying.
Croft looked at me utterly confused. “What…cat?” he asked. “A cat was
killed? I don’t understand.” I realized that Croft only knew the clean and
official narrative and nothing else. My hand kept fingering the Maxell
cassette and my eyes scanned the room for something to play it on but I
didn’t see anything. “He recorded torturing Matt. I don’t know why but he
left me a tape. It’s like a game he’s playing with me. Like a dare.” I stared at
Croft hoping I hadn’t sounded desperate but I knew that I’d become overtly
emotional and there was nothing I could do about it: an involuntary
adolescent reaction.
“Is Matt’s voice on the tape?” Croft asked lightly.
“Yes,” I said, and then, “Well, I…think so, it’s hard to tell. But I think
it’s him…”
“Is Robert’s voice,” Croft asked, “on this tape?”
“No, it’s, um, it’s a disguised voice,” I said. “It’s like a fake voice. Like
someone pretending to be like a monster or something.”
I realized as I said this that I wasn’t quite ready to show Croft the tape—
there was something off about his attitude. He wasn’t a believer. He was
already suspicious of me, and then he confirmed it.
“A monster?” he asked with an incredulity that bordered on amusement.
“A monster? Oh, Bret, please—”
“Look, Dr. Croft—”
“Why would Robert go to such lengths to do this to Matt Kellner?” Croft
asked, looking away from me and then back at the folder, which he reopened.
A gesture that relayed he wasn’t taking any of this seriously anymore. “Why
would he do this?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “Because he’s insane. Because he was in a mental
institution and I think he’s a deeply disturbed individual. I think he has a
mental disorder and he’s taking pills and he had this breakdown at Susan
Reynolds’s party, like a psychotic breakdown, and…” I was trying to sound
professional, and using terms that I thought made me seem like an adult:
deeply disturbed individual, mental disorder, psychotic breakdown. But I
stopped talking because I was losing Croft and I wanted to clarify myself
before he completely dismissed me. And then I couldn’t help it—my need to
push the story expanded and started crossing the line into an even darker
narrative than the one about Matt Kellner and the beating at Crystal Cove and
the staging of a suicide in Encino. “I think that…” I started and then stopped.
“You think what?” Dr. Croft asked blankly, looking up from my file.
“Do you know what…the Trawler is?” I asked.
“The Trawler?” Croft asked back. “You mean the serial killer?”
“Yes, yes,” I said, nodding. “The serial killer. Four girls—well, three.
They haven’t found the fourth one yet. And, um, maybe there have been
more and we just don’t know, maybe boys too—”
“I’ve been reading about the case,” Croft said hesitantly, wondering
where I was going with this. “It’s very disturbing.”
“Robert Mallory went out with the first girl who died,” I said. “Katherine
Latchford. He dated her. In the weeks before she disappeared. In 1980. When
he first came out here and was staying with his aunt.”
Croft studied me, and I thought from the expression on his face that he
had become increasingly concerned about what I was telling him, or so I
hoped, and that he wanted to hear more. I continued, unable to stop myself.
“And there’s a time line that fits whenever Robert was in L.A. The home
invasions and the assaults that began in the summer of 1980 started when
Robert was first out here from Chicago. And then they stopped once he left.
They began again when he returned for the holidays and then in January,
while he was still here, um, Sarah…” I’d forgotten her last name for a
moment. “Sarah Johnson disappeared and the same with Julie Selwyn—he
was here, just after Roycemore, in June, his aunt told me. And now Audrey
Barbour.” I was so keyed up I had to stop myself and look down. I was
clutching my knees and trying to steady my breathing. My fingers had left the
cassette what seemed like a long time ago.
Finally, I heard Croft say softly, “That’s an awfully big leap.”
This caused me to look up and stare directly at him. “Did you know what
happened to his mother? How she died?”
“She had a terrible accident,” Croft said, nodding. “Something about a
fall.”
“Just like Terry Schaffer fell on Saturday night,” I said. “It was exactly
like what happened to Terry Schaffer. And Robert was at that party. And I
believe he was responsible.”
A silence lasted longer than it should have as Croft studied me, deciding
what to say next. “I heard about Terry,” Croft finally murmured. “Does
anyone know what happened? You’re close to Debbie, aren’t you?”
“I believe Robert was responsible for that accident,” I was saying. “I
think he pushed Terry off the landing just like I think he pushed his
mother…”
Croft looked at me helplessly, as if he was getting increasingly impatient
with my presence. “Again, why would he possibly do this, Bret?”
“Because he’s insane, he’s sick,” I said. “He raped his stepsister. Did you
know that? That he told her to shave her pussy and that he raped her?”
Someone walked past the window and startled me and I jumped in my chair:
but it was only Miguel, the head of maintenance, with one of the gardeners.
“Bret,” Croft said, his face a strained grimace, “I really want you to calm
down.”
“I am calm,” I said, trying to sound as cool as possible. “I’m calm but
you don’t seem to be taking any of this seriously.”
“You don’t seem like you’re calm,” Croft said. “In fact you’re saying
some fairly incendiary things and you’re accusing a classmate of some pretty
serious stuff—”
Stuff. The word stuff minimized what I was conveying to Dr. Croft and it
caused me to stumble, because I realized I’d lost whatever control I thought I
had in the conversation when he used that word.
“Look, I’m fine, I’m fine—”
“I don’t think you are,” Croft said over me, his eyes wide with concern.
“You seem to be freaking out.”
“I’m not freaking out,” I said. “I’m the only one putting the pieces
together.”
“I think this all sounds kind of speculative,” Croft said in a sympathetic
way, suggesting I needed not only to relax but to rethink everything I was
telling him.
“You don’t know what I know,” I said.
“I guess I don’t.” He closed the file again and leaned back, studying me.
With the door shut Croft’s office was completely silent: you couldn’t hear the
phones ringing or the electric typewriters or the sounds of faculty leaving the
lounge and heading toward their second-period classes, the soft murmurs of
the secretaries. I stared back at Croft. It seemed he was hesitant about telling
me something. He cocked his head and continued taking me in. He sighed.
“Liz Schaffer called me last week,” Croft finally said.
I just stared at him. “Yeah? So?” I asked.
“I don’t know what prompted this but she was under the assumption that
you and her husband are, um, somehow…” Croft didn’t know how to say this
without being indirect. “…involved with each other somehow. That you’ve
become close to Terry…”
I continued to stare at him, paralyzed, even though it felt like my entire
body was dropping through the air with no landing in sight: just one
continuous free-fall that would last forever. It was mild outside and the office
was air-conditioned but I was sweating beneath the Buckley uniform: my
armpits were wet and sticky and my back was damp. Croft kept talking.
“Now, she seemed a bit out of it when she called and I assume this is a
delusion of hers—”
“She’s an alcoholic,” I managed to say.
Croft closed his eyes and held his hands up in a diplomatic manner.
“Yes, I’m aware of Mrs. Schaffer’s problem and I know that she can be
rather high-strung, but she seems to think that she has…proof.”
I kept staring at Croft. The world was receding. Robert Mallory was
receding. My whole reason for being in Dr. Croft’s office was becoming
dismantled. This was no longer the conversation I wanted to have. I had
mentioned the Trawler and somehow Liz Schaffer was taking precedence
over a serial killer. “About what?” I asked. “Proof of what?”
“That you and Terry are having…some kind of relationship.” Croft
shrugged, widened his eyes.
“She’s a sick drunk,” I said.
Croft ignored that and instead conceded, seeming to side with no one,
“You’re not legally an adult but you’re almost eighteen. However, Bret—”
“It’s not true,” I said. “It’s a lie.”
“Well, I hope it is,” Croft said. “It sounded unlikely.” But he didn’t seem
entirely convinced when he said this. The expression on his face suggested
that the student sitting across from him was capable of doing anything and
saying anything and making horrendous shit up and that whatever
acquaintance I had with Croft was now irreparably damaged. He would never
look at me in the same way again. He would always be distrustful of me. He
would always think I was crazy. But I suddenly didn’t care: I’d be out of
Buckley in eight months.
“This isn’t about Terry or Liz—” I started.
“But you brought Terry up—”
“Because of Robert Mallory,” I said. “This was always about Robert
Mallory.” I paused. “I didn’t come here to talk about Liz or Terry Schaffer. I
came here to talk about Robert Mallory and what I think he’s capable of.”
Croft paused again, pondering something—a thought, an idea—that
maybe he shouldn’t relay to me but that I had somehow forced him into
admitting because the nature of the conversation I’d initiated demanded it.
This was somehow my fault.
“I have to say, Bret, that this is all very strange, very odd,” Croft
murmured. “You coming in here and telling me that you think Robert is
connected to Matt Kellner.”
“What is?” I asked. “I don’t understand. Why?”
“Well, because I spoke to Robert almost three weeks ago,” Croft said. “I
actually wanted to talk to him about Matt and find out what he knew,
considering what Ronald Kellner told us: that Robert was the last person Matt
had mentioned to him.”
“Robert was in here?” I asked. “I don’t understand,” I said, squinting at
him. I had shifted to the edge of the chair.
“Well, he seemed to think”—Croft placed his hands together and clasped
them—“well, that you had something to do with Matt’s, um, predicament, is
what he, um, called it—”
“Predicament?” I asked.
“Well, about whatever led up to what happened,” Croft said. “Not what
ultimately happened, of course—he didn’t accuse you of that or anything like
that. But Robert said you and Matt were, again, involved in…” Croft trailed
off and then found his voice. “…a fairly intense friendship and that…”
My hands were clenched into one fist on my lap.
“Wait,” I said, my eyes closed. “Robert came in here and told you that I
was involved in a…” I said softly and then stopped.
“Not with his death,” Dr. Croft clarified. “But that Matt and you had a
falling out over something.” He paused. “Something intimate.”
I felt any hope quickly drain out of me. I was suddenly light-headed and
exhausted, even though I had slept for almost fourteen hours last night. It was
over. Did you like inserting the cock in your anus? Did you like sucking the
cock? Did you like the cock in your asshole? Why was the person asking
Matt that? Who was the person that had inserted his cock into Matt? Who
was the person whose dick Matt sucked? It was mine. I had done all of these
things to Matt and people knew: Susan, Ryan, Robert, probably Debbie. This
was the moment when I realized why I hadn’t played the tape for anyone and
that I probably was never going to play the tape for anyone: I’d be the only
one implicated.
“I mean, who are we to believe?” Croft asked. “Two boys with rather
active imaginations?” He paused. “Do you have something against Robert
Mallory?” he asked. “Did he do something to you?”
“He’s a liar,” I muttered. “Don’t compare me to him.” And then in a
helpless voice asked, “He actually said I had something to do with Matt?” I
looked down and muttered, “He’s a liar. He lies all the time.”
“You do know that Ronald Kellner doesn’t think Robert Mallory had
anything to do with Matt’s death,” Croft said. “Ron certainly told you that,
correct?”
I would become a suspect if I wanted to pursue this, I realized.
“You want to be a writer, I heard,” Croft was saying, placing the folder
about me back into the drawer he had lifted it from. “Mrs. Zimmerman told
me that you were looking for a college with a good writing program.
Mr. Robbins said he read a couple of pieces you wrote and that you have
talent.” He paused. “They were rather provocative, Mr. Robbins said—‘really
wild’ were his exact words. Very imaginative.” He paused. I had shown
Mr. Robbins two sections from an early draft of Less Than Zero—a chapter
where Julian was the narrator and describing a sexual tryst he had with an
older businessman in a motel room. And there was another chapter that
involved a missing girl who turned up dead in a backyard in Bel Air, mauled
to death by what turned out to be a werewolf—the details were gory, lurid,
sexualized, her vagina had been torn open. This fact seemed to sum up and
prove something for Dr. Croft.
Croft was already standing and this announced the meeting had ended
and soon we could hear the chiming of the bells indicating first period was
over and in five minutes second period would begin and the day would move
along in its contained and regulated way. This meant I was supposed to stand
up too, and I grabbed the arm of the chair to steady myself as I stood. I
suddenly wanted to lunge toward him, grab him by his jacket and plead that
he had to believe me, that if he didn’t believe me I wouldn’t know where else
to go, what else to do, everything would be lost, Robert Mallory would get
away with everything, who knew if Audrey Barbour was dead or still alive,
something could get saved if Croft believed me, Susan Reynolds was in
danger and so was Deborah Schaffer, my girlfriend—and then I remembered:
Thom Wright would be back tomorrow.
“How long have your parents been away?” I heard Croft ask.
“They left…um, the week before Labor Day,” I said quietly.
“And when are they coming back?” he asked.
“They are coming back…” I had to think about it, do the math. “In two
or three weeks,” I suddenly said, surprised how soon they were returning and
how long they’d been traveling. “Before Thanksgiving.”
“So they’ve been gone about two months now,” Croft said, confirming
this.
“Yes.”
Croft had stepped around the desk and was guiding me toward the door
he was opening. The sounds of the office returned but were louder now, with
faculty walking in and out during the break between first and second periods
and a few students inquiring about schedules and requests with a number of
secretaries.
“My guess is that you’ve been alone and isolated,” Croft said. “And that
maybe this has affected you in ways that might have ignited your
imagination.” He said this as if it was supposed to make me feel better.
I still had enough strength and self-respect to say, “No, no, that’s not it.”
“Okay, well, I want you to take it easy,” Croft said. “And let the
authorities figure this out. Let them handle it.” He paused and then he felt the
need to add, “I want you to realize this conversation was confidential. It
wasn’t on the record. Cone of Silence, and all that.”
He suddenly called out to his secretary, “Sherry, are the Wilsons still
coming in at ten?” Sherry nodded yes and Croft turned back to me. “Look, if
you need to talk to someone the school has references for a number of
doctors that we could recommend.” I smiled shakily at him and muttered that
I was fine, everything was fine, I was sorry I bothered him, maybe I’ve been
isolated, maybe I’ve been fitting the pieces together in the wrong way and I’d
take a break from all this and just focus on my homework and reschedule
retaking the SATs and make an appointment with Mrs. Zimmerman. Croft
clasped my shoulder before I walked away and left the administration
building. He looked at me. I looked at him. We didn’t know what else to say
—that was it. I took the walkway that would lead me back to the senior
parking lot, away from the rest of Buckley. I noted where Robert’s Porsche
was parked as I slid into the 450SL and headed to the house on Benedict
Canyon.
—
AT TEN O’CLOCK on that first Monday in November there was very little
traffic heading up Beverly Glen. At its peak I made a left onto a deserted
Mulholland, and then turned right onto Benedict Canyon, which was also
empty. When I arrived at the house I noticed only a pool-cleaning van parked
up the street and about three houses down was a gardener’s flatbed truck—
there were no other cars around. I turned into the driveway and put the
Mercedes in PARK and got out to push open the wrought-iron gate with the
mud-streaked WARNING: NO TRESPASSING sign hanging crookedly on it and then,
back in the car, I steered it up the gravel road that smoothed out into the stone
driveway curving in front of the house. There was nothing menacing or
decrepit about the condition of the house—its exterior was clean and well
kept. It might have been abandoned during the protracted divorce between
Abigail Mallory and her husband but it was maintained in such good
condition—or so it seemed from the outside—that the white paint coating the
house looked fresh, as did the gleaming pine-green shutters (nonfunctional
and purely a decorative touch), and the gray shingles that adorned the sloping
roof looked new. The house itself was anonymous, not fancy, almost
featureless—it could have existed in any town or city—but because of its
location in the canyons of Los Angeles there was something exotic about it
and it was probably worth a lot of money. I had no fear anymore, or at least
not in that moment—it had blown up in Dr. Croft’s office—and what carried
me toward the house was anger.
I knew the front door, white and lined with green trim, was going to be
locked when I walked through the arched entry, though I tried it anyway, and
the large bay window was concealed with thin venetian blinds so you
couldn’t see into the living room. I walked around to the right side of the
house, but there wasn’t a door until I entered the backyard, where the
towering oaks and sycamores looming over the property shaded the house
from the mid-morning sun. If the front of the house seemed well taken care of
the backyard was a shambles by comparison: the old tennis court with a
sagging net was still strewn with leaves and the pool was mostly empty,
except there was about a foot of blackish water in the deep end, also
blanketed with leaves, and the patio furniture scattered around the deck was
rusted. A pair of French doors I expected led into the kitchen and a den were
both curtained and locked. I then walked around to the other side of the house
and noted how eerily quiet it was at the bottom of the canyon as I glanced up
at the steeply rising hillside behind the backyard. There were three aluminum
trash cans lining this side of the house, along with a number of wooden
boards leaning against the gray stucco wall, and there was a single windowed
door, also shaded, and I was suddenly electrified when I gripped the knob and
it turned. This door was, for some reason, unlocked. I opened the door and
entered the house.
—
I WALKED into a small and musty room that contained a washer and dryer.
There was a shelf above them where a bottle of detergent, a can of Lysol, a
folded towel and a red toolbox sat. I opened the toolbox: it contained nothing
but a hammer, a few nails, a screwdriver, a pair of pliers and oversized
scissors. It didn’t mean anything, it didn’t prove anything, the tools were
clean, they were just objects in a toolbox, they weren’t weapons—my mind
raced calmly. I pocketed the pair of pliers and left the laundry room and
moved down a short hallway and past a guest bathroom and then I was
standing in the foyer, where the living room and what was probably the den
or a dining room and a kitchen were all within my line of vision, huge rooms
spread out in a vast space. And the house was almost completely devoid of
furniture, though there was a couch in the empty living room and a table with
no chairs in the kitchen, and I suddenly realized I didn’t know how Abigail
Mallory or her ex-husband made a living—he had done business, I vaguely
remembered, with Ronald Kellner—and that the furniture in the Century City
condo would have been too modern, almost awkward, in this particular and
more conventional house, which had a homier feel, something a family could
live in, and maybe someday would if the place was ever sold. The house was
immaculate—it had recently been cleaned. There didn’t seem to be dust
anywhere and it smelled as if the kitchen was mopped. There was a door I
thought was a closet but when I found it locked I realized it probably led to
the garage.
But I wasn’t as interested in the first floor of the house as I was the
second story. I wanted to go upstairs and find the room Robert occupied. As I
made my way up the staircase, set off by the foyer and across from the
kitchen, the house was so silent that I involuntarily jumped when the heel of
the penny loafer I was wearing slipped and knocked against one of the
polished oak steps that led to the second floor. Again, this wasn’t necessarily
fear—just a pulsing, heightened sense of anger: Robert had reduced me to
this. No one was trying to put the pieces together but me.
And then I remembered Thom Wright was returning to L.A. that night
and the anger enlarged itself.
—
THE SECOND FLOOR of the house was much larger than it seemed from
outside—the sloping roof had suggested something cozier, more compact.
There was one big empty space directly across from the top of the stairs, its
windows concealed with venetian blinds, that I assumed was the master
bedroom, and then I walked down a wide carpeted hallway and passed
another large empty room, again darkened. There was a long stretch of
hallway without any doorways or rooms but suddenly I stopped at a
bathroom when I noticed items in it: a can of shaving cream, a bar of soap,
towels hung from a rack, and when I looked in the shower stall there was a
brown bottle of Vidal Sassoon shampoo, a jar of Noxzema, and a razor. And
then, just past the bathroom, was the space that Robert occupied, which was
the room at the very end of the long hallway: a futon mattress with a large
bunched-up gray blanket and a couple of pillows with gray cases, and a
Tensor lamp sat on the bare wooden floor next to the mattress—this was
beneath a window that looked over the driveway; an empty bottle of 7Up sat
on its ledge. The room smelled like weed and I automatically located a small
bag next to the futon: there were rolling papers and a glass pipe and an
ashtray, and large white candles surrounded the futon on paper plates, some
melted down further than others. An electric typewriter sat on a small
makeshift desk made from the same kind of boards that were leaning against
the left side of the house, and as did a boom box similar to the one in
Robert’s bedroom in Century City, cassette tapes scattered around it—the
English Beat’s Wha’ppen, Was (Not Was), Tom Verlaine’s Dreamtime—
along with a small stack of mass-market paperbacks we’d be reading that
term: The Catcher in the Rye, On the Road, The Grapes of Wrath. There
wasn’t a chest of drawers but I noticed a closet door that was slightly ajar and
walked over and opened it: a pile of mostly black T-shirts, a couple pairs of
tennis shorts, sandals, two pairs of black jeans. I didn’t see any underwear
and suddenly wondered if Robert even wore them when not at school and
became faintly aroused. I wanted to smell a shirt I lifted off the floor, and
that’s when I uncovered an issue of Penthouse from July, and a Hustler from
June, and the first thing that shocked me in the house on Benedict Canyon
was the jar of Vaseline that I reached for and opened—the image of the gel
traced by his fingers was abstractly erotic.
—
I THEN went back to the makeshift desk, where there were two spiral-bound
notebooks that had nothing written in them. I froze anyway, but since it had
already been revealed to me what I discovered in one of them wasn’t a
complete surprise, just quietly ominous: a number of articles about Katherine
Latchford that had been clipped from the Los Angeles Times, beginning
during the summer of 1980 and laying out a long narrative of what happened
to the girl: articles about her disappearance from the party, about her social
life, her academic life, articles detailing the weeks she was missing,
interviews with family members and friends, the first details of the
mysterious phone calls, and the rearrangements in her bedroom, and then the
discovery of the body, and countless follow-up articles about the murder.
There was a copy of Los Angeles Magazine from November of 1980 with
Ann-Margaret on the cover that also had an article about what happened to
Katherine Latchford. But there were no clipped articles about the other girls:
nothing about Sarah Johnson or Julie Selwyn or Audrey Barbour. I closed the
notebook and noticed that a number of keys were on the desk and one was
marked “CC 2802”—this was a key to the door of Abigail Mallory’s
penthouse on the twenty-eighth floor of the Century Towers, which I
pocketed. And then I realized I wanted to see if any of the other keys would
open the locked door downstairs. But none of them opened it—none of them
even fit into the keyhole. I went back upstairs and replaced the keys on
Robert’s desk. I reopened the notebook with the articles about Katherine
Latchford, because some of them were paper-clipped together, and I pulled
the clip from a two-page article and unfolded it as I walked back downstairs
and to the locked door I figured led to the garage. This was all done in a calm
and purposeful manner—my anger had dissipated and there wasn’t anything
else replacing it. I was alone in an abandoned house off a canyon road where
a murderer sometimes resided, but whatever fear and dread I should have
experienced there was now simply a numbness that blanketed everything.
The paper clip slid into the keyhole on the handle and I quickly unlocked the
door, revealing a darkened stairwell that led not to the garage but to what
looked like a basement, a rarity in L.A. It was completely silent.
—
THERE WAS ONLY a moment of trepidation before I started moving
toward the stairway and then my hand wandered the wall in the darkness and
landed on a switch and a lone lightbulb in the ceiling at the bottom of the
stairs suddenly lit up.
I noticed nothing unusual about the space as I slowly made my way
down the stairs—in fact it seemed totally unused. It was just an empty room
that smelled damp and faintly of rot. And then I realized that the stairway led
to another door, deeper into the basement. But the paper clip would not open
that door—there were two keyholes and it was seemingly bolted tightly from
within. When I turned away from the door I was surprised to see that a small
corner of the basement was actually being used as storage space: there were
deflated rafts and a number of blue kickboards for the pool, a broom, a mop. I
neared a large wall of floor-to-ceiling cupboards. I opened one and didn’t
understand what I was looking at. It took a moment to adjust. There was a
large bag half filled with dry dog food, maybe twenty tins of Purina Cat
Chow, a bag of birdseed, and then I saw on the bottom shelf a row of empty
glass bowls that might seem innocent enough but were, I realized, for fish—
empty fishbowls lined in a row. In the adjoining cupboard were a number of
small steel cages that were used to transport animals—a pet, a small dog, a
cat, a guinea pig, hamsters. And then I became genuinely startled when I
noticed something staring at me from a glass box—it was completely still and
I didn’t know what it was at first, only that it was alive.
It was, I realized finally, an iguana in a sad facsimile of whatever its
natural habitat would have been. The glass cage was lined with sand dotted
with rocks and there was a small bottle of water affixed to the side of the cage
with a spigot. The reptilian face just stared at me until it didn’t, and I finally
found my breath. I suddenly felt sick and I quickly closed the cupboard doors
and shambled up the staircase, forgetting to close and relock the door I’d
jimmied open. I rushed down the hallway to the laundry room and burst out
of the house, slamming the door shut behind me. I walked quickly to my car
and got in and started it. I drove the car across the stone driveway and then
down the gravel path that led to Benedict Canyon. I drove the car past the
opened gate, put it into PARK and got out to close the gate. I pulled the gate
closed and then, just as I was about to get back into the car, I saw a vehicle
parked about four houses down on the other side of the canyon road, just
idling as if it was waiting for someone, or paused before heading to Hutton
and the stoplight there. It was the beige-colored van.
—
I DON’T KNOW why exactly but I started walking toward it, and slowly at
first, because a horrible curiosity overwhelmed whatever fear had previously
enveloped me, and there was the need for an answer, and then I started
running at the van as it pulled away from the curb. I yelled out “Hey!” and
ran faster along the canyon road and then tripped over a fallen tree branch
and skidded hard onto the asphalt as the van sped down Benedict. My palms
were scratched and I’d torn the knee on the gray slacks and scraped the skin.
As I pushed myself up I saw that the van had stopped again and without
thinking I scrambled toward it, but then the van lurched away from me. And
then it braked suddenly, the red taillights flashing on, sunlight reflected in the
windows of its back doors, which were tinted black. I realized I’d hurt my leg
more than I initially thought and I was limping toward the van; there were no
other cars coming either up or down the canyon road and it was so quiet. It
was almost as if whoever was driving the van was taunting me, or being
instructed by someone else inside the van, I thought, to tease this meddler,
this little pussy, the maricón. I moved closer to the van as it idled on the
canyon road, and then it decided to drive away, but slowly, until it
disappeared around a curve. I waited a beat and then hurriedly headed back to
the car, my palms and knee stinging from the fall, as a crushing sense of
disappointment dropped onto me: I had failed to see the license-plate number.
A few cars eventually passed on my way back to the Mercedes, where I got
into the driver’s seat and gripped the steering wheel hard in order to calm
myself. And then I mindlessly decided to turn left onto the canyon road and
press down on the accelerator, trying to catch up with the van. But I didn’t
find it—I drove all the way to Sunset Boulevard above the speed limit and
realized the van must have made a turn onto one of the many roads that
streamed and twisted across the canyons.
—
I NEVER WENT back to Buckley that day. Instead I just drove aimlessly.
I made it as far out as Bakersfield and then to Barstow and then I don’t
know how I found myself in Lancaster—I was just driving without any sense
of destination or purpose. I filled the car up at a 76 station in Littlerock,
where I washed my scratched palms in the men’s-room sink and wetted a
towel and wiped the gravel still stuck to my scraped knee and then ended up
in Pasadena and drove all the way down to Anaheim, and when I hit
Huntington I realized I could find the beach at Crystal Cove and park on the
bluff where Matt Kellner’s bloodstained backpack had been found and where
he was tortured in front of a bonfire, but decided I couldn’t—what would the
point be, why would I hurt myself like that? I wasn’t listening to music; it
was completely silent within the cabin of the Mercedes as I just kept
processing what I’d seen in the house on Benedict Canyon and then just as
quickly trying to forget what was in it. I drove up the coast and got all the
way to Malibu by the time night was falling and thought about stopping at
Jeff Taylor’s in the Colony to buy Quaaludes and weed but realized I
couldn’t talk to anybody. I wouldn’t be capable of speech; a conversation, let
alone a transaction, would have been impossible. Thousand Oaks, Simi
Valley, and then I hit traffic on the 405 heading back to the empty house on
Mulholland. By the time I returned home it was almost nine o’clock and the
gas tank was near empty—I had filled it up again at a gas station on Pacific
Coast Highway at dusk. I was starving and exhausted as I let myself into the
house. Shingy danced around me while I opened the refrigerator and just
stared into it until I began to weep. I moved to the bedroom and took off my
uniform and ignored the red light blinking on the answering machine and
opened the drawer of my nightstand and took the two Valiums I had left and
then spent forty minutes in the shower, until I was tired enough to dry myself
off and fall into bed, where my only point of reference was the blank, wide
face of an iguana staring at me from a glass cage in the locked basement of a
house on Benedict Canyon. That night I slept through the six phone calls that
landed hourly, a silent message recorded each time; I could barely hear the
shallow breaths on the other end of the line when I listened to them the next
morning.
27
TUESDAY. I took half of a Quaalude before I left for Buckley. I drove into
the parking lot and could feel the drug lightly pressing down on me, slowly
erasing any fear or sadness, worry or doubt—it was going to transform Bret
into the tangible participant and promised to ease me through the day, which
would be watery, with everything shimmering in the glow of the Quaalude. I
drove by Ryan Vaughn talking to Thom Wright, the two of them standing by
the white Corvette no one had seen for a week, and I offered a surprised face
at Thom, who smiled tightly at me and then turned back to Ryan. I parked in
my space and sat still, controlling my breathing, murmuring to myself that it
was going to be okay, until I felt relaxed enough to confront the morning—it
wasn’t as if the Quaalude had already hit (this usually took about thirty
minutes—I was almost there) but it was the idea it would be hitting me soon
that offered comfort and peace.
As I got out of the car and slung the Gucci backpack over my shoulder I
noticed, one row over, Debbie talking to Rita Lee and Tracy Goldman by her
BMW. Debbie automatically noticed me and offered a casual wave,
unsmiling as she kept talking, and I nodded at her as I headed to Thom. I
didn’t see Susan’s car and I didn’t even bother looking for Robert’s Porsche.
In my tracking shot I watched as Ryan clapped Thom on the back and began
walking out of the moving frame—this would ordinarily have wounded me
but the thought of the Quaalude overtaking my consciousness was making
everything bearable and I smiled as I approached Thom. His hair was wavier
than usual and there was light stubble on his face, which meant he probably
hadn’t shaved all week. He offered a wan smile as I neared him. He seemed
tired up close and thinner. “Welcome back. How was the trip?” I asked.
“Change your mind and going to UMass?” He offered a forced grin and
shook his head. “No,” he said quietly. “Don’t think so.” He checked his
watch and looked out over the parking lot, distracted. And then he turned
back to me. I knew that he was looking for Susan’s car and that he’d been
waiting for her. It was nearing nine o’clock and we watched as the girls
started heading toward us, moving across the parking lot, a reminder that
class was starting soon. “You stayed for a football game,” I said. “So it
must’ve been fun.”
“I didn’t want to stay,” Thom said. “But my dad already had the tickets.”
“Why didn’t you want to stay?” I asked.
He became briefly annoyed. “I was already gone a week.”
“How’s Lionel?” I asked, wanting to engage him and erase this distance
that was separating us.
“He’s good, I guess,” Thom said, unenthusiastic. He started telling me
about the trip but he was going through the motions—he didn’t care and
really had nothing to say. And then he stopped as if he remembered
something. “I talked to Susan last night,” he said as we neared the bell tower.
“When I got back.” I dreaded the mention of her name but knew it was
inevitable.
“Yeah?” was all I asked.
“She told me what happened to Terry,” Thom said. “Jeez, how did that
happen?”
I stopped walking. “Thom.”
He turned. “Yeah?”
I just stared at him, not knowing what to say. He quickly became
concerned.
“What is it, dude?” he asked quietly.
“I think, um, that…” I began. I felt I could say anything. I was about to
start melting and I was feeling so loose that I could have simply blurted out
the truth: Susan and Robert are together. And I almost did, before we were
interrupted. Thom looked up and I felt a hand on my neck and then Debbie
kissed me on the lips and smiled at Thom as Rita and Tracy passed us.
“Welcome back,” she said.
“Hey, Debbie.” Thom cocked his head. “There’s something different
about you…”
Debbie cocked her head as well, waiting.
“It’s the hair,” he said, smiling, as if pleased with himself for figuring it
out, momentarily taking him away from whatever was troubling him. “Looks
great.”
“Thanks.”
Debbie walked with us beneath the bell tower, heading toward our first
class.
“We were just talking about what happened to your dad,” Thom said.
“You talk to him?” I asked her. “Did you find out what happened?”
“No,” she said. “He doesn’t remember. He had been, in his own words,
inebriated and wasted. Blitzed. He remembers nothing. He doesn’t even
remember what he was doing upstairs.” Liz and Debbie had visited him,
separately, at UCLA Medical Center on Monday afternoon. “Where were you
yesterday?” she softly asked me.
This was how Terry was going to play it, I dully realized in that moment.
He wasn’t going to blame anyone, no one was pushed, he wasn’t going to
bring Robert Mallory into the narrative, which would now fade away because
it was an accident Terry couldn’t remember.
I ignored Debbie’s question. “So he doesn’t remember if it was an
accident?”
“What would it be otherwise?” she asked. “Why wouldn’t it be an
accident?”
“Maybe he was pushed,” I suggested, remarkably calm.
“Pushed by who, Bret?” Debbie sighed heavily.
“I mean, I just wondered if he actually fell or if he was pushed,” I said. “I
guess Terry doesn’t remember.”
“No, my father doesn’t remember,” she said with a quiet finality that I
translated into: Don’t ever ask me this again.
We arrived at the bungalows just past the administration building and
Thom paused at the classroom I was about to enter and then checked his
watch and without saying anything headed off to his first period, and Debbie
waited until he was out of earshot to ask me if I was all right. This was
becoming her mantra to me, and if I hadn’t been on the verge of getting
stoned I might’ve said something allusive and bitchy, but the Quaalude let me
kiss her forehead and assure her I was fine. She wasn’t convinced and stared
at me hard. “What?” I asked, feeling completely relaxed. “What’s wrong?”
“Are you high?” she said. “You’re high, aren’t you?”
“A little,” I confessed. “I took half a ’lude before school.”
“Why?” she asked. “Are you still upset?”
“No,” I lied. “I’m better. Everything is fine.”
“What were you talking to Thom about?”
“Nothing,” I said. Debbie’s presence was suddenly straining against the
oncoming blurry warmth of the drug.
And then she said in a low voice, “You’re not going to do something
stupid and tell Thom anything, right?” I waved a hand in front of her face to
indicate she had nothing to worry about and kissed her again and then floated
into American Fiction and sat at my desk, glancing over at where Susan
should have been. I was able to acknowledge Ryan and pulled out my copy of
Slaughterhouse Five and smiled woozily at Mr. Robbins. The bells were
chiming and I noticed a figure dashing along the walkway beyond the tinted
windows and it was Susan, who made it to class just before the bells faded.
She nodded at Mr. Robbins and then slid into the seat next to mine. I realized
that she had purposefully arrived late, not wanting to see Thom—or anyone
else—in person. I don’t remember saying anything to her and I can’t
remember the next class, but at assembly the dream threatened to unravel
when Robert Mallory appeared, standing in the courtyard beneath the
Pavilion, where I watched as Thom gave him a very quick dude-hug. I had
thought that Thom was figuring something out, that he had spent the week
putting the pieces together, that somehow he knew Robert Mallory wasn’t
gay, and that Susan’s new blankness was tied into moving away from Thom,
preparing herself for a future without him—but apparently not.
After assembly Thom and Susan were standing beneath the flagpole
before Phys Ed and I could finally feel the faint new spike in the narrative
that would be altering everything soon. They were softly talking to each
other; this was a seemingly normal conversation—placid, even. Thom
seemed to be asking soft questions and Susan seemed to be softly answering
him and there was nothing angry or defiant in either of their stances. But only
if you didn’t know the secret history that was playing itself out. You would
have thought this was a couple in love, a dream, the sensitive jock and the
numb beauty, the high school cliché, reunited after a week apart.
—
BUT ON GILLEY FIELD Thom walked up to where I was lying on the
bleachers, his body blocking everything out except the crisp neon-blue
autumn sky edged around him. I was enjoying my high, stoning out on the
small green world below, prone at the top of the stands, forgetting everything
I’d seen in the abandoned house on Benedict Canyon, and the beige-colored
van, and the 5th Dimension poster hanging in Debbie’s bedroom, and the
phone calls both she and I had been receiving. Thom stood over me, backlit,
just a shadow, and I took off my sunglasses and stared up at him. “Did you
know that Susan went to Palm Springs last weekend?” was the first thing he
asked. I didn’t know how to answer that.
“Yeah.” I shrugged. “To see her grandparents. Right?”
Thom was silent. I struggled to sit up. He just stood over me.
“She didn’t pick up any of my calls,” he said tonelessly. “She was never
home to pick up any of my calls. She only called back once. The entire
week.”
“But weren’t…you traveling around?” I managed to ask.
He ignored me. “She never told me she was going to Palm Springs and
she goes the day I left? She never told me that.” He turned and looked at the
field as if he was searching for her. She was standing by the tennis courts
with Debbie—they were both holding rackets and wearing sunglasses. Robert
wasn’t on the field. Thom’s outline turned back to me. “Did she go with
anybody? Did she go with Debbie?”
“I don’t think she—”
“Had she mentioned anything to you?” He cut me off.
“No, she hadn’t,” I said. “Didn’t she tell you?”
“That she was going to Palm Springs to see her grandparents? No.” He
paused. “She said that she had and that I’d forgotten.”
Anger was about to obliterate the high I was coasting on.
“Robert was out in Palm Springs, too,” I said, controlling myself to not
go any further than that. Thom had to piece this together on his own. He
would never forgive me if I told him the truth—I would always be connected
to his pain.
“Robert?” Thom asked. “Mallory?”
“Yeah,” I said. “He was out there, too, that weekend…”
“So what?” he said, confused, and then, “Were they together?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “Robert was staying in Rancho Mirage.”
“What are you trying to say, Bret?” Thom asked in the coldest voice I’d
ever heard from him.
“I don’t think Robert is gay,” I said quietly.
Thom didn’t say anything. He just stood there, immobile.
“How do you know that,” Thom finally said. He did not inflect this as a
question.
“Thom…” I started, again yearning to tell him what I knew.
He just stood above me, looking down, trying to process whatever I was
attempting to tell him—processing not the precise information exactly but
why I seemed so tentative and lost when I was trying to talk to him about his
girlfriend and Robert Mallory. The shape standing above me seemed gripped
in a small but rising panic. He knew I wanted to tell him something he really
didn’t want to hear, and I ultimately didn’t. I was both surprised and not
surprised that it had taken Thom Wright as long as it did to figure out that
something was very wrong.
—
HE MADE the connection at lunch that day and I remember I had never seen
anything as magical as Thom silently staring at Susan and Robert beneath the
shadow of the Pavilion and realizing something—his silent realization was
more thrilling than any elaborate special effect. I didn’t want to sit with
anyone, so I arrived at the row of senior tables early and sat two over from
the center table—I didn’t want my high interrupted. But when Debbie saw
where I was sitting she just slid in across from me, followed by Susan and
Thom, who also sat across from each other—and I noted that Thom hadn’t
brought a lunch, which suggested something had been misplaced or broken, a
lack of order had surfaced in Thom’s world; he didn’t care anymore. The talk
between Debbie and Susan was chatty and perfunctory, with Thom and me
often not saying anything. And then Robert showed up and sat next to Susan
and it was that one moment when Susan and Robert casually ignored each
other that gave Thom the meaning he needed to help him see more of what
was going on and expand the narrative. I watched Thom while Susan and
Debbie kept talking, and though they tried, once or twice, to engage me or
Thom, they completely ignored Robert. This was the wrong move, the bad
tactic, the thing that made Thom suspect, the strain was so obvious. I stared
as Thom noticed this and his face subtly shifted expressions: it was so light
there was barely a signal, but I was the one watching Thom pretending to
listen to the girls’ conversation. I was the one who saw his eyes moving from
Susan to Robert as the conversation continued. I was the one who felt his
frustration and the betrayal. He actually pushed away from the bench and
scowled lightly to himself at one point, as if he suddenly remembered
something he had to do after school and had forgotten about. It was a very
small motion and I was the only one who saw it, I thought, closing my eyes
for a moment.
“So you were out in Palm Springs, too,” Thom finally said, staring at
Robert, with something like wonder.
He had interrupted the conversation between the girls and it suddenly
stopped.
“Two weekends ago,” Thom said quietly. “When Susan was out there.
Visiting her grandparents.”
Robert said, “We didn’t even know we were both out there until I got
back to school on Monday.”
“How did you know this?” Susan asked Thom, curious. “I mean that
Robert was out there.”
“Bret told me,” Thom said flatly.
I could tell Susan looked over at me but I was staring at Thom.
“Oh,” she said. I heard her ask me, “You did?” I ignored her.
“What were you doing there?” Thom asked.
“Visiting some friends,” Robert said.
“What friends?” Thom asked. “I didn’t think you had any friends.
Friends from L.A.? Who else do you know in L.A. but us?”
“Friends of my family,” Robert said. “Friends from Chicago.”
“Really?” Thom asked. “They’re out in the desert? In Rancho Mirage?
Your friends from Chicago.”
“Yeah,” Robert said. “Why?”
“I don’t know,” Thom said, looking between Susan and Robert, his eyes
darting from one blank face to the other. “It just sounds weird.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Susan said. “You sound weird.”
“Yeah, babe, it does,” Thom countered. “You’re both out there the same
weekend and you never told me you were going out there in the first place?”
The way Susan said, “What are you trying to say?” was both an awful
tease and a rehearsed denial. What was maddening about witnessing this was
that if you knew the truth—as everyone at that table did except Thom, who
was just now realizing it—this was a kind of torture for Thom, and I didn’t
understand what their plan was, how they were going to let him down easy, if
they were even going to tell Thom at all. Maybe they just hoped he’d figure it
out for himself without any confirmation and then move away from Susan
and on to someone else.
“I’m not trying to say anything,” Thom said casually. He shrugged.
“Hey, dude,” Robert said, leaning forward.
“Stop it,” Thom snapped. “Just stop it.”
“I think you’re tired,” Susan said, reaching over the table and grabbing
Thom’s hand. “I think you had a long week and we haven’t talked and we
need to hang out after school. Okay? Can we do that? Is that okay?”
Thom stopped pulling away from her and relented. He wasn’t saying
anything.
“Thom?” Susan asked, trying to refocus him. “Can we please hang out
after school today?”
“I have practice,” Thom muttered.
“After practice.” Susan sighed.
“Sure, babe,” he said tightly. He then glanced over at Robert and
changed his mind and softened. “It’s been a long week. Susan’s right. I’m
sorry.” When Thom admitted this the mood at the table lightened up, even
though he sounded just as rehearsed as Susan had. It was happening, I
thought to myself. It was really happening.
—
THE school day ended with me sitting in the passenger seat of Jeff Taylor’s
Porsche 924 as he separated a number of white pills out of a plastic baggie
and dropped them into my open palm, which was lightly scratched with scabs
from when I fell on Benedict Canyon the day before, and which I pocketed
before handing him fifty dollars. The car reeked of weed—it had settled into
the upholstery and the dashboard—and Jeff was tan from surfing and his hair
was bleached by the sun and I was still high from the half-Quaalude I’d taken
—150 milligrams could usually carry me over eight to ten hours but I wanted
to make sure I had a supply in case of another anxiety attack—and the
BusBoys were singing “Did You See Me?” and I felt I had to tell Jeff that I
wasn’t taking the ’ludes recreationally. For some reason on that afternoon it
was necessary to impart this to Jeff—I needed them to get through my days,
that was it, did he understand, was he truly my friend. “I don’t care, brother,”
Jeff said good-naturedly. “Do whatever you want.” I watched through the
windshield as Robert walked by himself, a load of books under his arm, to
the black Porsche and simply got in without looking around.
“I heard you and Tracy were invited to Robert’s birthday dinner,” I said,
feeling a coldness, a dark chill, drifting over the sunny warmth created by the
drug.
“Yeah,” Jeff said tentatively, sealing the bag and reaching over my lap,
placing it back into the glove compartment. “I’m not sure we’re going.” He
clarified. “At least I’m not going.”
“Why not?”
“I’m getting some weird vibes from whatever the situation is,” Jeff said
vaguely.
“What’s the situation?”
“You haven’t noticed?” he asked.
“Noticed what?”
“What’s going on between Robert and Susan?” He looked at me.
“Oh, that,” I said, quietly stunned that Jeff had paid enough attention and
knew about this.
“Until they all figure it out, or at least tell Thom about whatever they’re
doing, I’m staying out of it,” he said, and then he asked, “Don’t you know
what’s happening?”
“No, I don’t. I mean yeah, of course, yeah, of course I do,” I said,
watching Robert’s Porsche glide out of the parking lot. I wondered if he was
heading to Century City or the abandoned house on Benedict Canyon as I got
out of Jeff’s car and floated to the Mercedes and drove home. It was around
three-thirty when I pulled into the garage.
—
THE PHONE RINGING IS WHAT WOKE ME UP. When I squinted over at
the clock I saw it was nine and the room was completely dark. I vaguely
remember driving home from Buckley and dropping into the pool after taking
my uniform off. I swam through the cool water and it heightened the
sensation of the drug and then I remember actually trying to work out in the
makeshift gym—something I had been doing regularly because it helped
manage the fear—push-ups, biceps curls, and I had muscles now, there was
definition. But a wave of exhaustion had washed over me and I remember
lying down to rest—something I never did during the day—and falling into
what turned out to be a long sleep. I didn’t recognize the voice that was
coming from the answering machine. “Bret. Pick up. Bret. Pick up.” It was a
man, and I thought at first it was my father calling from some distant country
overseas and I reached for the phone and fumbled with the cord, untangling it
as I sat up in bed. “Hello?” I said.
“Bret. It’s Terry.”
“Hey, Terry,” I said, squinting around the darkness of the room. The
Santa Anas had started up again and the wind was softly wailing across the
backyard. I turned on the Tensor lamp by the bed, which made the rest of the
room seem suddenly darker.
“I need you to do me a favor,” he said.
“Where are you?” I asked, confused.
“I’m at Cedars,” he said. “I was transferred today. Look, I need you to do
something for me. It’s important.”
“Okay,” I said tentatively. “What…is it?”
“I need you to drive out to Malibu,” he said. I noticed that his voice
sounded strained, slightly desperate.
“What time is it?” I knew what time it was but needed to reorient myself
after the drug-induced nap.
“I don’t know. Nine, I think,” Terry said.
“What’s wrong, Terry?” I was suddenly scared for myself. I initially
thought this had something to do with me, or whatever happened between us
weeks ago in the bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel—why else would Terry
Schaffer call me at nine o’clock on a Tuesday night? He said, “Something
happened to the goddamn horse at the stables.”
It took me a moment. I said the horse’s name. “Spirit.”
“Yeah,” Terry sighed. “Look, Steve left for New York this morning or
else I’d send him out there,” Terry was saying, referring to Steven Reinhardt.
“But he’s gone—”
“I can’t go, Terry,” I said. “It’s nine o’clock.” I paused. “It’s a school
night,” I lamely added.
“Connie Myerson is heading over there now. She’s the owner of the
stables,” Terry said. “She’s expecting you in—”
“What happened?” I asked, interrupting him.
He sighed. “A security guard was making the rounds earlier and there
was something wrong with the horse. I don’t know. They won’t tell me what.
It was injured, it was involved in an accident, I don’t know—they just said
there had been an accident of some kind and that someone needs to come out
there to verify something for the insurance policy.” Terry paused. “Look, I
need you to drive out and tell me what happened. Just be my witness. I
already told Connie Myerson I’m sending you.”
“Terry—” I started.
“I need to know what happened to the horse, Bret,” Terry insisted. “It’s
now considered a crime scene but they will not tell me what happened over
the phone.”
I got out of bed and stood there naked, my legs wobbling. Terry’s fear
had made me clearheaded and ready to obey him and I automatically started
getting dressed, reaching for the jockey shorts and then the uniform lying on
the floor next to the bed that I’d been wearing earlier that day. “What am I
supposed to do?” I asked.
“This shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours and I’ll owe you bigtime,” Terry said. “Drive out there, see what happened to the horse, call me,
and then you can go home.” He paused. “I’ll owe you big-time,” he said
again. “We can talk about that script you want to write. I’ve been thinking
about it.”
I was cradling the phone in my neck as I pulled the gray slacks on and
reached down to pick up the white shirt. “Yeah?” I asked. “Really?”
“Yeah, yeah,” he said hurriedly.
“Cool,” I said. “Okay.”
“Debbie doesn’t need to know anything yet and I want it kept that way
until I find out what happened,” Terry said. “I want you to call me directly
from the stables and inform me on what happened. It’s simple. I’ll owe you.”
I sighed and then slipped my feet into the loafers I’d worn to school.
“You know where it is?” he asked. “Windover Stables?”
“Yeah,” I muttered. “I remember.”
“And call me as soon as you find out,” he said. “They have the number
to reach me here. Connie has it.”
—
I TOOK MULHOLLAND to the 405 and drove the brightly lit freeway
through the darkened Sepulveda Pass until I reached the 10 and curved right
and moved across the empty lanes until it merged onto the Pacific Coast
Highway. This would be faster than taking Sunset all the way to the beach,
which was usually my preferred route to Malibu, and the one I’d probably
take home after checking out Spirit and leaving the stables. I passed the
Jonathan Club and sped along the coast, flying through every light until I
reached Malibu, and the Santa Anas were gusting and the ocean off to my left
was alive with waves below a huge orange moon. As I neared the turn for the
Windover Stables whatever sparse traffic had lightened up to the point where
it seemed there was no one around, just faraway headlights slowly cruising
toward me down the coast, only darkness in the distance mirrored in the
rearview. The road leading up to the stables wasn’t lit and so I relied on my
high-beams to guide the Mercedes up the winding hillside until I arrived at
the parking lot, where two Malibu sheriff’s cars and a Windover Stables van
and a Volvo station wagon were parked outside the front office. I pulled the
Mercedes next to one of the sheriff’s cars. The wind thrashed the bending
trees lining the trail behind the front office, leading to the stables, and then
died down just as quickly as it rose up toward the sky again. I opened the
door to the offices.
—
A WOMAN IN her early fifties, elegant yet also vaguely haggard, was
smoking a cigarette while talking quietly on the phone, dressed in a long
wool coat, wearing a flowered headscarf. Behind her were two Malibu
sheriff’s officers conferring with each other next to a table where a security
guard sat with his arms on his knees, ashen, shell-shocked, and the officers
were subdued as well, talking in low murmurs. The atmosphere surrounding
the narrative about what had happened to Spirit suddenly changed for me as I
stood in the office. It was more serious than I thought. There didn’t seem to
be any sudden rush to repair the horse, to heal it or take care of it. It seemed
that something had already concluded itself. There was no accident, no
injuries, no life to save. The four people noticed me but no one said anything.
Connie talked to whoever was on the other line about “the problems” with the
cult in Venice and then in Santa Monica, the incidents that had been
occurring along the coast—she didn’t say the name but I knew she was
talking about the Riders of the Afterlife. Connie Myerson hung up the phone
and stared at me wearily. “I’m Bret Ellis,” I said. “Terry Schaffer sent me.”
Connie nodded and motioned for the sheriff’s officers. “They’ll take you to
the stables and then you can come back and call Terry from here,” she said
softly.
I followed the two officers in the darkness, their flashlights guiding us
along the tree-lined trail, the wind gusting up and dying down in rhythmic
patterns, until we reached the stairs that led to the darkened arena and past
that, the lit stables, and beyond the stables stood a forest of trees blocking the
Pacific, and only the orange moon could be seen through the black branches
surrounding the stables. There was another sheriff’s officer standing by a
large green-and-white-striped structure, a barn, who held a walkie-talkie to
his mouth, which he lowered as he saw the other officers approaching with
me hanging behind them. A jolt of fear struck me as I saw how grim-faced he
looked. None of the men said anything—just nodded at each other. “What
happened?” I asked. No one answered. One of the officers gestured for me to
follow him into the barn—I noticed how eerily quiet everything was once we
entered. The floor of the barn was packed with dirt and lit with fluorescent
lights and the officer stopped at a door, its top half open; I could now hear a
whirring sound inside. The officer stepped into the space and made a gesture
with his hand. Again, it meant I should follow him. We walked into a
darkened area. He flicked on the lights.
—
THE FLOOR WAS LINED with hay and there were bales of it stacked
against the wall. The space we walked into was where they were housing
Spirit and it led toward a shoulder-high fence and past that the open center of
the barn ringed with other private stables, all closed—we had come in
through a side door. There were two large rotating fans moving back and
forth across the stall where something huge was covered with what looked
like a beige canvas tarpaulin. It was bloodstained.
“Why are the fans on?” I asked, swallowing, confused.
“To keep away the insects and the bats,” the officer said, reaching out to
pull the tarpaulin off the shape.
At first I didn’t know what I was looking at. But it was the horse. It was
Spirit. It was somehow sitting up, propped against the wall, its hind legs
splayed out in front of the animal, its front hooves hung over its chest, and its
hide was wet with fresh blood everywhere though only two or three places
seemed opened up; the most glaring was a large bright-pink wound where the
animal had been gutted, its stomach carved open, purple and blue entrails
bulging out. I looked down and finally noticed the pool of blood that reached
out to where I was standing—I hadn’t seen it when I walked in. I looked back
at the horse. The ears were sliced off and its tongue had been pulled all the
way out of its throat and was draped over its chest—just like Alex the cat.
The horse’s eyes were kept widened with what looked like giant silver nails,
so that the animal seemed surprised at what had happened to it. When I
looked back down at the floor there was a massive glistening pink snake
between the horse’s hind legs that I realized was the animal’s penis, which
had been pulled completely out of its body. I noticed that small silvery bats
had appeared from nowhere and were fluttering against the fans and toward
the horse and a few had landed and were crawling along the carcass, fighting
the manufactured wind. The officer waved them away with a broom and
quickly asked, “You good?” I nodded dumbly. And then he threw the
tarpaulin over the animal’s corpse, grunting with the effort. I looked up and
saw that a number of bats had lined the ceiling, waiting.
Back in the front office I called Terry in his private suite at Cedars and
tried to describe what I’d seen, until he told me to stop and that he didn’t
need to hear anything else. He asked me to hand the phone to Connie, who
took it from me and turned away. After hanging up, she handed me
something to sign attached to a clipboard. I numbly did, not knowing what it
was, and then realized I wasn’t needed any longer and simply drifted out to
where the cars were parked. It was only in the Mercedes, when the immediate
shock started fading, that I realized with a horrifying force that someone had
actually done this. Whether it was the Trawler or the Riders of the Afterlife
didn’t matter—someone had felt the need to move through the grounds of the
Windover Stables on that Tuesday night in November and target Debbie
Schaffer’s horse and then kill and mutilate it. I drove across Sunset through
the darkened hills and canyons, the orange moon always visible through the
branches of the trees, and I was shaking and moaning out loud. Fear was the
only sensation. I knew everything was ending and the paranoia that had been
humming around us was now flowering everywhere. It was back in the house
on Mulholland where I became positive that someone had broken in and
rearranged the towels in my bathroom, though I had no proof and couldn’t
remember. I made sure all the doors were locked, like I always did. I made
sure the butcher knife was in the drawer by my bed. I made sure Shingy slept
next to me, so he could bark out a warning when the intruder wearing the ski
mask broke into my room, his eyes wide with madness.
Debbie didn’t make it to school on Wednesday, and no one but me, not
even Susan, knew why yet.
28
WEDNESDAY MORNING Terry contacted his daughter before she left
Stone Canyon for school and asked her to visit him at Cedars-Sinai—he said
it was very important. Terry was going into a second operation later that day
and wanted to talk to her beforehand. Debbie arrived at the private suite and
Terry told her that something had happened to Spirit—the horse hadn’t been
mutilated; instead it had an unchecked “heart abnormality” that led to a
severe seizure the previous night and had to be put down by Mike Stevens,
the veterinarian overseeing Spirit. There was no mention about the Riders of
the Afterlife cult, who the Malibu sheriff’s office had convinced themselves
were responsible for the death of the horse but about whom they kept quiet at
Terry’s insistence, and there was no mention, or warning, about whether this
was the work of the Trawler. Debbie, according to Terry later that week, was
in a state of shock, as if she didn’t believe her father (she had thought he was
going to tell her that he and Liz were separating), and she left Cedars in a
rage. Instead of heading to Buckley she drove out to Malibu, and at the
stables she confronted Connie Myerson, who tried to calm Debbie with a
series of evasions and lies. Debbie ran down the trail and across the arena to
the barn, but Spirit, of course, had already been disposed of—Terry made
sure that happened quickly when he heard about what had been done to the
animal. Mike Stevens made arrangements, and at midnight on Tuesday a
truck rolled into the back of the stables and the three Malibu sheriff’s officers
and two assistants from the veterinary clinic hauled the horse onto a forklift
and had it driven to a crematorium to be disposed of, and the stable was
hosed down with bleach. There were photographs taken for insurance reasons
but nobody saw what had happened to the horse except for that small group
of witnesses on Tuesday night. Including myself. In order to get through
Wednesday, I pretended it wasn’t real, I concealed it. I didn’t go to school
that day.
After listening to the anguished, nonsensical messages Debbie left on her
answering machine when Susan got back from school, she drove to Bel Air,
where Debbie was sitting in her bedroom in the dark, wasted in a bikini; she
sobbed to Susan that no one would tell her what had happened, and that she
kept calling Mike Stevens, Spirit’s veterinarian, and he hadn’t been taking
her calls and then he suddenly did and confirmed what Terry had told her in
Cedars-Sinai earlier that day, but “They’re all lying to me!” she wailed even
though she had no proof, and Susan kept trying to calm her down and asked
why anyone would be lying to her—what would the point be? Debbie finally
passed out, exhausted with grief, and it was six when Susan drove back to
North Canon Drive. The mistake that Susan made after Debbie Schaffer
talked to her Wednesday night: Susan drove over to Robert Mallory’s in
Century City and not to Thom Wright’s on North Hillcrest. This was the
decision that caused the movement in Thom’s narrative to leap forward. This
simple decision helped speed everything up. Thom found out when he got
home from football practice and immediately called Susan at seven and
instead spoke to Gayle Reynolds, who had no idea what was going on
between Robert and her daughter and simply told him—innocently—that
Susan had gone to see Robert. Thom kept calm and then slammed down the
phone and called me, but by then, I had turned off the answering machine and
lowered the sound of the phone so that you could barely hear it ringing. I did
this because of the phone calls where no one said anything. And because I
couldn’t talk to Thom.
Debbie didn’t come to school Thursday either. But I did.
—
EVERYTHING SEEMED DREAMLIKE on that Thursday—a silent movie
played out in slow motion, and it was about evasion, encroaching despair,
secrets, everything leading up to a vague trap, and we were aware that we
were all in the same film even though we all wanted different endings. Susan
arrived late so she wouldn’t have to deal with Thom, who was waiting for
either Susan or Robert to arrive in the parking lot, and I waited silently with
him on that Thursday morning—he was too upset and distracted to have a
conversation, pacing by the bench beneath the bell tower, scowling at the
parking lot as it kept filling up. I didn’t know what was wrong until Thom
eventually told me he’d called Susan’s number a dozen times last night
without her answering and almost drove over to the house on Canon before
he regained his cool and tried to concentrate on homework, but he barely
slept—he was a wreck. When it seemed apparent that neither Susan nor
Robert was going to arrive before nine we both walked toward our firstperiod classes and said we’d see each other at assembly. He looked
exhausted. I had slept with the help from half a Quaalude and was just trying
to keep it together. Susan arrived at five after nine to Mr. Robbins’s class and
took her seat without saying anything to me. And then I saw Robert walking
by the green-tinted windows of the classroom moments later and realized
they had arrived together.
—
THERE WAS A TENSE conversation between Thom and Susan after first
period ended—Thom was already waiting outside American Fiction and I
walked quickly away from them and busied myself at my locker while Ryan
Vaughn ignored me. During assembly Dr. Croft scanned the crowd from
where he stood behind the microphone next to Susan and his eyes briefly
landed on mine as he spoke and briefly stopped before he continued the scan
while he kept talking—a reminder of the demented meeting I instigated in his
office on Monday. Robert was standing away from the crowd, in the distance,
on the steps leading up to the courtyard, where he could barely be seen. I
didn’t go to Gilley Field but PE wasn’t coed that day and so Thom and Susan
were separated until lunch, and that was when Thom and I and Robert and
Susan sat at the center table—it seemed like everyone else was avoiding us,
the bad vibes that Jeff Taylor had noticed were spreading out everywhere.
We were pretending that everything was okay when it obviously wasn’t and I
knew something was about to crack and I wanted it to—we needed to free
ourselves from the airlessness of the situation, we needed to get real, the
pantomime had finally become an obstacle. Susan was talking about Debbie’s
horse but, considering what was going on between Robert and Thom, it
barely registered with them. I didn’t tell anyone that I’d seen what happened
to Spirit because I was at the Windover Stables on Tuesday night and that
whoever murdered the horse had positioned long steel nails through the
animal’s face in order to widen its eyes, which popped out of its head,
mimicking an exaggerated expression of surprise. I nodded at Susan and went
along with the narrative about the heart abnormality and the seizure.
And then Robert let us know that he had canceled his birthday dinner at
Le Dome—Ryan had bailed, Tracy and Jeff had bailed, Debbie wasn’t
coming. However, Robert suggested that maybe the four of us could have
dinner that night instead. “Get together and talk,” he added.
—
“TALK ABOUT WHAT?” Thom asked, suddenly animated by the
suggestion. I noticed he wasn’t eating his lunch. He had it spread out in front
of him—but he wasn’t touching it. He just stared curiously at Robert. And it
became impossible not to realize that the four of us sitting together at the
center table beneath the Pavilion was a bad idea the minute we all took our
places.
“I think we need to clear the air about stuff,” Robert said, tentative.
“Clear the air about what?” Thom asked patiently. “Stuff?”
“I think there are things we need to talk about,” Robert said.
Thom mulled this over, or pretended to, while Susan dully stared at him.
“Maybe he’s right,” I said, more to Thom than anyone else. “Maybe we
should.”
“Why don’t we just talk here,” Thom said quietly. He stared back at
Susan. “I don’t want to go out to dinner.” And then, “Why wait?”
“Thom, come on,” Susan said.
“No, really, why don’t we just talk here,” Thom said. “What do you want
to say?”
Susan located the hostility in Thom’s tone and shifted on the bench
apprehensively. It was happening, I thought. It was really happening.
“Okay, well…” Robert started. “I think there has been some, um,
misapprehension about me that isn’t totally valid…” Robert stopped and
glanced over at where I was sitting and then his gaze calmly landed back on
Thom, who was very still and staring at Robert. “And I think you should tell
me what’s on your mind and just be honest instead of—”
“My girlfriend has been trying to convince me ever since I got back that
we should take a break,” Thom said as if Susan wasn’t there. “But she
wouldn’t say why. She just gave me these vague reasons—she needed to find
her own space, she wanted to spend her last year not as a couple but on her
own. And I kept asking her why—why is she so unhappy and distant?—and
she insisted that she wasn’t unhappy but that we should just be friends and I
had to ask her—though it just didn’t seem possible—if there was someone
else.” Thom paused. “She said no, but I didn’t believe her. That there wasn’t
someone else.”
Robert nodded. “What do you mean by someone else?”
“You,” I suddenly said—it had become unbearable enduring this
evasion. “You,” I said again simply and with no rancor. “Why don’t you two
just admit it and get everything over with.”
Susan looked at me with a coldness I’d never experienced from her
before. I was furious but contained it.
“What?” I asked. “Is there something wrong, Susan?”
Thom was sitting very still.
“Well, nothing has happened,” Robert said.
“That’s bullshit,” I said.
“Bret,” Susan warned.
“That’s bullshit.”
“So you’re admitting it,” Thom suddenly asked them.
We were all talking softly in low, hushed voices so no one around us
could hear what we were saying but we were giving off bad vibes, and I
quickly glanced around to see if anyone had noticed the tension rising off the
center table. I was startled to see Ryan staring at us while the rest of his table
was either pretending nothing was happening or just legitimately ignoring the
situation.
“You want me to do this here so I won’t make a scene in front of
everyone?” Thom was staring at Susan. “You don’t want to do this in
private?” His tone carried a faint hint of disgust.
“Why would you make a scene?” she asked. “We’re just talking. Jesus,
Thom.”
I looked over at Thom, who was in profile next to me. He was grinning
but it was frozen and fake—it was scary. He didn’t want to express
embarrassment or weakness and he kept very still. “I’m not going to make a
scene,” he said in a mild voice. “But I thought you were a friend.” He
directed this at Robert. And then looked at Susan: “Both of you.”
“He was never your friend, Thom,” I said. “He was never anybody’s
friend.”
“What is wrong with you?” Robert said to me.
“There’s nothing wrong with me,” I said. “You’re a liar and a freak,” I
said, unable to control myself.
“If you say so, Bret.” He sighed exaggeratedly. “But that’s the pot
calling the kettle black.”
“Going to Croft and telling him that I was somehow involved with
Matt’s death is pretty fucked up—” I started.
“I didn’t go to anybody,” Robert interrupted, talking over me. “I was
called in—”
“And you wanted to implicate me in—”
“You implicated yourself,” Robert said. “Stop it, Bret.” And then I
activated something. “Just shut the fuck up.”
Susan laid a hand on Robert’s wrist to calm him down. Thom noticed.
“You want me to tell Thom?” Robert asked. “About you and Matt?”
Without turning to him, I could see that Thom was now looking at me.
“Well, do you want to tell them what you did to him?” I asked. “And the
tape you made at Crystal Cove? And that you dated Katherine Latchford?” I
turned to Thom and then back at Susan. “She was the first victim of the
Trawler and this fucking freak dated her. And who the fuck knows what else
he did.” I was sickened by his presence but my voice remained low and calm.
No one said anything until Robert asked, “What do you think you’re
piecing together? You’re making up some kind of story about me?” His face
was a confused grimace. “Is that what you’re doing? Making up a story about
me?”
“I know all about you,” I said. “You’re a sick creep.”
“Bret, stop it,” Susan said harshly, but only lightly raising her voice.
Thom suddenly interrupted, leaning across the table, toward Robert.
“You came here, we took you in, I thought you were my friend, we
included you, we save your ass from some stupid freak-out where you
could’ve drowned, and we all knew about your past and I listened and was
sympathetic about your little stalker, this person following you around, and
this is what you do?” Thom swallowed and sat back. “You fucked my
girlfriend.”
Robert and Susan immediately leaned in to Thom and started quietly
talking over each other: “That’s not true, we haven’t done anything, stop it,
that’s not true.”
“You didn’t spend the night with him on Saturday?” I asked accusingly.
“No,” Susan said. “I didn’t.”
“I just don’t believe you, man,” Thom was saying to Robert.
Robert stood up and gathered his lunch into a brown paper bag and
simply walked to another table, where he forced a smile and sat next to Ryan
Vaughn, who slid over on the bench to accommodate him. Robert tried to
make this seem natural, as if he had just decided to change tables and nothing
else, but there had to be a reason and everyone at that table knew something
had happened at ours—a confirmation of the quiet drama that had taken
place. I saw Jeff looking over at me and mouthing What happened? and I
turned away.
“I’m done,” Susan said. “I don’t want to be with you anymore,” she said.
“We’re breaking up.” She spoke in a low voice but she was furious—I had
never seen her this enraged.
“I know that,” Thom said stoically. “You can fuck off now.”
“Good,” she said, pushing away from the table. “Just leave me alone for
a while and don’t call me.” She walked down the steps and through the
courtyard and out of the plaza, leaving Thom and me sitting there alone at the
center table. I was so embarrassed for Thom that I was locked in place and
didn’t know what to say. When he tried to put his uneaten lunch back into the
bag his hands were shaking. He was breathing evenly but when he suddenly
looked over at me there were tears in his eyes that he managed to control
until he couldn’t and then he got up, leaving his bag on the table, and jogged
quickly to the men’s restroom located in the lobby of the Pavilion; he didn’t
come out for the rest of lunch. I sat alone at the table and realized this was the
final act. It would all be over soon. No one from any of the other senior tables
came over to ask what had happened.
I didn’t see Thom the rest of the day, until school ended, when I noticed
that he was sitting in the Corvette in the senior parking lot sobbing and I
cautiously walked over until he noticed and looked up. I knelt next to the
driver’s side and Thom composed himself and then unrolled the window. He
wiped his wet and reddened face with the back of his hand and then reached
for a Kleenex to blow his nose. “I have practice in fifteen minutes,” he said in
a strained voice that was on the verge of breaking down again. “I don’t know
if I can do it.” I just nodded and had an overwhelming need to comfort Thom,
to stroke his jaw and run my fingers through his hair and tell him it would be
okay and then we’d kiss, our lips brushing against each other, I’d be there, he
could be with me, I’d never leave Thom for someone else.
Instead, I finally said, “We have to do something about him.”
—
I DIDN’T drive back to the house on Mulholland. I drove through the
canyons and cruised Century City and then headed to Westwood, where I
aimlessly walked around until dusk and bought a ticket to Shock Treatment. I
was the only person in the theater and couldn’t concentrate on the movie
because of everything collapsing around us—the shrill, satiric musical
numbers activated my fear: the movie’s manufactured absurdity made
everything so unbearable I could barely watch it. After it was over I walked
across Wilshire Boulevard to a sushi bar and sat at the counter and ordered
sake with my fake ID and a California roll but I wasn’t hungry. Buzzed from
the sake, I just drove around—I made it all the way out to the beach in
Venice and then I was driving through Culver City and soon the skyscrapers
of downtown were in the distance and in seconds it seemed I was on South
Figueroa, cruising past the Bonaventure Hotel, “Nowhere Girl” playing
continually in the tape deck. I was on the freeway and realized in a daze that I
was flying through the Cahuenga Pass when I saw the Hollywood Cross lit
above the Ford Amphitheatre and I found myself racing across the 101
passing through Burbank and Studio City and then Sherman Oaks and Encino
and Tarzana, until I was out in Woodland Hills, where I drove through the
now empty parking lot of the Promenade, the place where Audrey Barbour
had disappeared, and I tried to imagine that night: a girl getting into a
handsome boy’s Porsche, or was the beige-colored van idling up next to her
instead? The parking lot was ghostly and dotted with sodium lights
illuminating empty spaces and I was running low on gas and filled up at a 76
station on Ventura Boulevard. I thought about driving past the Kellners’
house on Haskell Avenue but it was nearing ten o’clock and I realized that
the night was passing by in a blur.
On Mulholland I parked the car in the garage and made sure it was
completely closed. I stepped into the hallway and was relieved that Rosa had
left the lights on—I wasn’t capable of walking into a darkened house.
Everything was quiet as I stepped into the kitchen. I was craving the sedation
of a Quaalude and knew I would have to take one—and smoke weed—to get
any sleep. I needed to move through Friday and then escape into the
weekend. I walked down the hallway toward my bedroom, unnerved at how
quiet it was.
I stopped after I opened the door and stood there, confused as to what I
was seeing.
Spread out on the neatly made bed were the jockey shorts I took from
Matt Kellner’s house and the Maxell cassette resting on top of them.
I realized in that moment that I hadn’t seen Shingy and I looked around
the room and called his name.
And I had just thought Why would Rosa have left the lights on? when the
phone suddenly rang and I cried out.
I picked it up and heard Debbie Schaffer screaming.
—
ON THAT THURSDAY NIGHT Debbie stayed in her bedroom in the house
on Stone Canyon, finishing the packets of cocaine she had stashed in her
nightstand drawer while drinking champagne. By eight o’clock: Liz Schaffer
had passed out in her bedroom, Steven Reinhardt would be flying in from
New York the following morning to guide Terry Schaffer out of Cedars-Sinai
and back to Bel Air, Maria was asleep in the maid’s quarters and Paul had
left for the day and driven to Baldwin Hills, where he lived with his wife and
young son. Earlier that evening Susan Reynolds had called Debbie, distraught
about the scene that played out at lunch between her and Thom and
convincing herself that the pain was equal to the loss of Spirit—Susan
reminded us later—who had only been with Debbie for about five months,
compared to the more than two years she and Thom Wright were together.
Susan told us that Debbie had sounded high and slightly drunk and said that
she didn’t want to talk and hung up on her. It was nine-fifteen when Bel Air
Security received a call from the Schaffer residence: it was Debbie who told
the security guard that their dog, Billie, was missing, and a patrol car arrived
at the house on Stone Canyon. Debbie gave a description of the absent pet to
the patrolman, who took down the information regarding the dog and noted
that “Miss Schaffer” seemed, in his estimation, “inebriated” and after he told
her they’d start looking for the dog that night, suggested that she go to bed
and get some sleep. Miss Schaffer became offended and told the patrolman to
go “fuck yourself” and then closed the front door. And then another call came
into Bel Air Security twenty minutes later, again from Debbie Schaffer.
—
DEBBIE HAD DECIDED to go swimming that night but the pool lights
weren’t working—later it was found out the wires had been cut—and after
diving in and during a lap “someone” grabbed her foot in the pool and tried to
pull her under, according to Miss Schaffer. This seemed highly unlikely to
the guard in the Bel Air Security office but the patrolman who had taken
down the information about Billie drove back to the house on Stone Canyon,
where a “hysterical” Miss Schaffer, who was wet and shivering and waiting
in the driveway wearing only a bikini with a beach towel draped over her
shoulders, said that she had been “attacked” by “someone” in the darkened
pool. “Someone grabbed my fucking foot in the fucking pool” were her exact
words and she said that she had screamed and then “kicked at it”—and then
“a hand” grabbed her ankle again—and Debbie desperately splashed out of
the pool and ran up the lawn to the house. She was positive that someone had
slipped into the pool while she was swimming and was going to “drown” her.
She also mentioned the calls: the phone in her room kept ringing and
someone kept hanging up. Debbie had contacted the Beverly Hills Police
Department as well and while she was talking to the Bel Air Security
patrolman two cops pulled into the driveway on what was a slow Thursday
night and decided to search the property. Maria slept through this. Liz slept
through this as well. Neither had any recollection of hearing anything when
asked in the following days about the disappearance.
It was at this point that Debbie called Susan and told her that she was
coming over and spending the night and Susan said that was fine and waited
for her arrival. Debbie never made it to North Canon Drive.
Out by the pool one of the policemen discovered a blood drag—as if an
animal had been attacked and wounded and then dragged away. The blood
drag continued across the concrete surrounding the pool and all the way to
the lawn and the two cops followed the blood-splattered grass with their
flashlights until the blood drag died out. It was decided by the policemen that
a coyote had probably attacked the Schaffers’ pet and dragged it off
somewhere in the canyons, where the dog was presumably eaten. They would
let Miss Schaffer know at a later date—she was too keyed up and wasted at
this point.
—
DEBBIE WAS walking down the staircase to the foyer, dressed and carrying
an overnight bag, when she stopped and finally noticed the manila envelope
Liz had left earlier that evening on the table that sat next to the front door. It
had Debbie’s name written on it in Liz’s handwriting. The photos of Terry
and me were explicit—I saw them later—and there was no denying who was
in the photos or what we were doing on that Sunday afternoon in October in a
bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. And this was when Debbie called me, at
ten-fifteen, and started screaming hysterically in front of the two police
officers and the Bel Air Security patrolman: How could you have done this
with my father, I knew about Matt Kellner, I didn’t care, I thought you’d been
experimenting, Susan told me, but Terry is my father, she screamed, and then
she started screaming about Liz, who stayed passed out during Debbie’s
breakdown, for marrying Terry, for having a child, for being a fucking
alcoholic. And then she hung up and, according to the three witnesses,
collapsed on the floor and sat there sobbing, the pornographic photos
scattered around her. She composed herself minutes later and told the
Beverly Hills Police Department and Bel Air patrolman they could leave, not
to worry, she wasn’t getting behind the wheel of a car, they could just go, she
was going to bed, and after checking the first floor of the house the three men
reluctantly agreed.
But the next morning Debbie’s BMW was gone and there were blood
droplets spattered across the driveway and she never arrived at Susan’s, or
the empty house on Mulholland or at Buckley the following day.
29
AFTER DEBBIE hung up I was trembling so hard from the shock of what
she screamed that I could barely make my way to the nightstand where the
Quaaludes were waiting—I was involuntarily shaking so hard I was
vibrating. I sat on the edge of the bed after swallowing one, not knowing how
I was going to survive without losing my mind until the pill hit me twenty
minutes later. The world was collapsing, wreckage was strewn everywhere, I
had no control over anything. But you never had, I realized when I could
finally stand up and look down at Matt’s jockey shorts and the Maxell tape
that had been laid out on the bed. My first thought was that Rosa had
straightened the drawers and simply laid these items out, wondering if I
wanted to keep them—this had happened once or twice before, especially if I
told her I was looking for something that I’d lost. But other thoughts blocked
that very real possibility and though I tried ignoring any other ominous
scenarios I couldn’t help but think: Why were all the lights in the house on?
And then I remembered: “Shingy.”
I called the name uselessly as I floated through the house but he didn’t
appear. I was quickly going under as I stumbled to my mom’s room, where I
locked the door behind me and then dragged the comforter off her bed and
shut myself in the walk-in closet and let myself be knocked out. I actually fell
to my knees as blackness crashed over me. I woke up when I thought I heard
Shingy barking from somewhere within the house but it was only loudly in
my dream, because when I unlocked the bedroom door and walked through
the empty living room in the early dawn light the dog was nowhere to be
seen: not on his pillow in the kitchen, not outside on the lawn, or under the
desk in my bedroom—his food and water bowls were empty. But the
Quaalude I’d taken last night was calming enough to help me pretend
everything was normal: The Quaalude would help me go to school and accept
whatever my fate was going to be that day. The Quaalude would help me deal
with the humiliation of Debbie confronting me. And then I thought calmly,
with the Quaalude’s help: let everyone know the truth, you’ll be free, you can
vanquish the tangible participant and be yourself, you’re too young to play a
role, you’re too young to become an adult yet.
In my bedroom I placed Matt’s jockey shorts and the cassette back in the
bottom drawer. And though I was still moving underwater because of the
drug I took the night before, I could also accept anything while it kept
flowing through my system—nothing would faze me, nothing could hurt me.
I had finally achieved a level of numbness that I didn’t think was possible. I
was floating over the same empty desert plains Susan was floating over and
toward which ultimately we were all heading: some of us just arrived there
sooner than others. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh,
Vienna.
—
BEFORE I LEFT FOR BUCKLEY that morning the phone in my bedroom
rang and it was Steven Reinhardt calling from the American Airlines terminal
at LAX after landing from a 5:00 a.m. flight out of JFK, to ask if Debbie was
with me. I didn’t pick up and he ended up leaving a message about how
Debbie had disappeared from Stone Canyon and Terry and Liz were having
him reach out to anyone who was close to her and see if she’d driven over to
their house to spend the night—there was blood by the pool, there was blood
on the driveway, everyone was worried. I carefully drove to school and
parked in the senior lot and saw Susan waiting for someone beneath the bell
tower. “She didn’t come to your house?” was the first thing Susan asked me
as I approached her. “No,” I said. “I had no idea she left Bel Air.” I was
genuinely shocked at first that Susan had told Debbie about Matt Kellner at
some point during the past few weeks and anger briefly flared below the
constant warmth created by the drug but in the end it didn’t really matter—
Debbie was gone, Matt was gone—and I wasn’t going to confront Susan
about this on that morning when everything else mattered so much more.
Things were speeding up: an added urgency seemed to touch everyone.
“Something happened last night, she sounded crazy,” Susan said in a
whispered voice. “She was freaking out. I talked to Liz this morning,” she
said, and then added, “They say they’re going to file a missing-person
report.” Susan was trying to remain calm but light traces of panic permeated
the numbness she had perfected.
“Maybe she’s just, um, hanging with, um, someone we don’t know,” I
mumbled, completely numb from the Quaalude. “I don’t think they’re going
to file anything yet.”
“This isn’t like Debbie,” Susan said. “You know that, Bret.”
I nodded. “Yeah, yeah, I know.”
“Did she call you?” Susan asked. “Last night?”
I nodded again.
“What did she say?” Susan asked.
“She was…fucked up,” I said, shrugging. Looking back, I realized in that
moment that neither Susan Reynolds nor Steven Reinhardt knew about the
photos of me and Terry yet. “She wasn’t making any sense,” I said. “I
couldn’t understand what she was saying.” I paused. “I thought she might
come over but she never did.” I paused again. “I thought about going to Bel
Air but it was late…” I trailed off.
“She was supposed to come to my place,” Susan said. “I don’t know
what happened. Her car was gone. There was blood on the driveway. Billie
was gone.” Susan suddenly held a hand to her mouth and choked back a sob.
Her eyes were tearing. The fear had finally eradicated the numbness.
“What do you mean…Billie is gone?” I asked hollowly.
Susan was watching something behind me. I turned. Robert’s Porsche
was pulling into the parking lot. I remained calm as I watched him get out of
the car, but desire and disgust messed everything up and I had to turn away.
As I left her Susan felt she had to say, “I’m with him now. You know that,
right, Bret? That I’m with Robert now.”
“I know,” I said, walking away from her. “Yeah, I know.”
“And are you okay?” she asked. “About that?”
“I’ll see you in class,” I murmured and floated beneath the bell tower on
the walkways below the eaves.
Thom Wright never showed up to school that day.
—
AFTER ASSEMBLY the senior class was told by Coach Holtz that PE had
been canceled. Instead, we sat around the courtyard beneath the Pavilion, and
by then everyone had heard not only about Debbie’s horse but that Debbie
was actually missing, and a number of the girls—Michelle Stevenson, Tracy
Goldman, Karen Landis, Nancy Dalloway, Katie Harris, Rita Lee, Danielle
Peters—were being brought into the administration offices one by one, and
seated across from Dr. Croft as Liz Schaffer asked them questions over the
speaker phone from the house on Stone Canyon. But no one knew where
Debbie was—she had legitimately vanished. And then the whispered
conversations began, when each girl came back to the courtyard and joined
the group assembled there and another one was called in. There were coded
lines of dialogue that if you translated them carefully revealed perhaps that
Debbie was unstable, perhaps she used heavy drugs, maybe Debbie fucked
guys in bands, maybe Debbie was a slut, maybe Debbie had gotten mixed up
with the “wrong people,” and there was a rumor that she had found
“something” out about her dad, and wasn’t Terry gay and did this have
anything to do with the accident that happened on Saturday night at the
Schaffers’ party? I was sitting among these girls and Tony Matthews and Jeff
Taylor and Dominic Thompson and Kyle Colson, and the conversation about
Debbie proceeded anyway—it continued as if the presence of her boyfriend
didn’t matter. Most of the senior class left during lunch, and a group met up
at the McDonald’s in Sherman Oaks but I was so unnerved by my invisibility
I couldn’t join them. Robert and Susan sat on the periphery of the courtyard,
only talking to each other. No one spoke to me—without Debbie I just
quietly disappeared. Thom Wright’s not showing up to school that day was
the catalyst for me to go home—it was an indication that we had reached the
end of the pantomime.
—
AT THE HOUSE ON MULHOLLAND Rosa was concerned about Shingy
and I told her she should leave for the day and that the dog would come back
or I assured her I’d find him. I assured her it had only been a day. I assured
her that he’d run away before even though he hadn’t. Rosa wanted to contact
my mother but I told her not to—“They’ll be back soon,” I said. “Don’t
worry my mom,” I said. “Wait until Shingy comes home,” I said. Rosa was
apprehensive but she usually left early on Fridays and I told her to relax and
have a nice weekend and that I’d see her Monday and that Shingy would
probably be back by then as I guided her to the front door and watched as she
hesitantly walked down the steps to the orange Nova she drove from East Los
Angeles. But before she left I had to ask her if she went through the drawers
of my desk yesterday and placed a pair of underwear and a cassette tape on
the bed and Rosa turned and said no—she didn’t know what I was talking
about.
“Did you leave the lights on?” I asked. “Last night?” I clarified. “Before
you left?”
She looked up at me confused and said, “No, I didn’t leave the lights on.
I never leave the lights on.”
I stood on the steps leading out to the driveway and watched her get into
the car, feeling nothing, though I should have been afraid. I heard my phone
ringing past the open door and turned around slowly, listening until it
stopped. Whoever it was didn’t leave a message. But for some reason I knew
they would call back. I stepped into the foyer, closed the front door and then
locked it and had started moving down the hallway toward my room when
the phone began ringing again. I stood in the doorway listening as the
answering machine picked up. “Bret.” Pause. “Bret. Are you there?” Pause.
“Bret. Pick up. It’s Terry.” I moved slowly to the phone and though I didn’t
want to pick it up I had to find out how Debbie knew about what happened at
the Beverly Hills Hotel. I reached for the phone and lifted the receiver.
“Hello?” I said hollowly.
“Hey,” Terry said. “It’s me.” He sounded sedated and faraway, groggy
from whatever medication he was taking.
“Where are you?” I asked.
“I’m still at Cedars.” He sighed. “They wouldn’t discharge me. Doctors
all ganged up.” He paused. “Look, I can’t really talk right now but you need
to know something.”
I knew what he was going to say but I didn’t tell him what Debbie had
screamed at me over the phone the night before.
“What?” I said, standing in the bedroom as the afternoon light began
fading away.
“Liz had me followed for a couple weeks in October,” Terry said quietly.
And then he stopped, as if this information was enough.
I didn’t say anything.
“I don’t know how the fuck it happened,” he said. “I’m usually discreet.
But someone ended up photographing us at the hotel.”
“Photographing us?” Hearing this from Terry himself made me nauseous
and I had to sit down on the bed. I was dizzy. I thought it was just a rumor
Debbie had convinced herself was real. And then I remembered the proof that
Dr. Croft had mentioned—the proof that Liz Schaffer told him existed.
“And Debbie found out,” Terry said. “I think that’s maybe why she
disappeared. Liz told her.”
I couldn’t say anything.
“I’m sorry about this, Bret,” Terry said. “But I’m taking the blame. It’s
my fault.”
“What should I do?” I finally asked.
“Nothing,” Terry said. “I just wanted to, um, warn you.” He paused. “I’ll
try to smooth this out on my own. But…” He trailed off, suddenly distracted.
Something was happening in the suite at Cedars. And then Terry said, “I
can’t talk now.”
“Terry?” I said.
Suddenly there was an agitated voice in the background. I heard it ask,
“Who are you on the phone with? You shouldn’t be on the phone.” It was
Liz.
Terry lied, made up a name, someone named Sam.
There was a rustling sound and I heard Liz speaking directly into the
phone. “Who is this? Is this Sam?” She paused, and then I could hear her
look over at Terry. “Who is on the phone, Terry?” Terry was now talking to
Steve Reinhardt, who had entered the room, and he ignored his wife. I should
have hung up but I didn’t. I wanted to explain to Liz that none of this was my
fault. “Hello?” she was saying. I said nothing. “You’re such an asshole,” I
heard her say to Terry. I continued to say nothing. “Hello, who is this?” And
then she abruptly stopped and realized something. I heard an intake of breath;
a kind of borderline gasp, and then Liz said in a low voice, “How dare you
call here. How dare you. You are not welcome anywhere near me or my
husband or my daughter. You are not welcome anywhere near us. You are a
very sick young man. You should be ashamed of yourself.” I could barely
hear both Terry and Steven telling Liz to hang up and then I heard the phone
being wrested away from her—what sounded like a brief struggle occurred
before someone else was holding the phone. It was Steven Reinhardt calmly
saying something while Liz screamed incoherently at Terry. “Hey, Bret,” he
said coolly. “We’re having some problems here. You shouldn’t call anymore,
okay? You should have known better.” He paused. “You’ve been warned.”
There was another pause. “Remember that. I warned you.” He said this over
Liz screaming in the background. “Okay? Got it?” And there was a click and
then silence.
—
I ENDED UP in the makeshift gym, where I tried to work out. The exertion
eradicated the pain and replaced it with something else. It was momentarily
calming and moved me away from myself. I took a shower and threw on a
bathing suit and a Polo shirt and walked outside, where I called Shingy’s
name again. It was around four o’clock and there was nothing—just the
ambient sound coming from the canyons below and cars racing along
Mulholland behind the boxwood hedge. I spent the next ten minutes
barricading the house for the night by making sure everything was securely
locked: the garage, the front door, the side doors, the kitchen doors, all the
windows latched tight. I debated unplugging the phone, because it kept
ringing and someone always hung up and I wasn’t going to be the victim that
would answer it, playing along with the game the caller was instigating, I
wasn’t going to be the target unknowingly drawn to their fate. Instead I
turned the volume on the ringer down and at five o’clock fell onto the bed
and drifted in and out of a Quaalude sleep, willing it to come so it would
annihilate me into an endless unconsciousness: silence, slow-motion waves, a
night sky scattered with faraway stars, a healing peace. In one of the sleepless
moments I thought I heard the doorbell ringing and then, after a moment of
confusion, realized the doorbell actually was ringing and I clutched myself,
adrenaline coursing through me. I waited. It was night now and the yard was
lit. And through the bay window of my bedroom I saw someone walking
across the lawn. It was Robert Mallory and he was calling my name. “Bret, I
know you’re here. Bret, open the door. Let me in.”
—
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A DREAM at first, and that I was still
sleeping, but realized that this was real. And I wasn’t as frightened as I
thought I’d be if he ever showed up, because I was now used to him, he was
known and he was still wearing the Buckley slacks and the shirt from earlier
in the day and he wasn’t the wide-eyed madman in the ski mask with the
butcher knife assaulting me in a planned home invasion. He was just the
ultimate version of the preppie fantasy boy I jerked off to—in this incarnation
he seemed safe. I got off the bed and turned the lights on in my room—it was
seven o’clock—and then moved down the hallway and watched as he came
to the kitchen doors, which he leaned toward and peered through. “I know
you’re in there,” he said loudly. “Open up.” He paused. “We need to talk.” I
hesitated before I touched the panel on the wall and the kitchen bloomed with
light. I walked toward the locked door he was standing behind.
“What are you doing here?” I asked. “I don’t want you here. I’m going to
call the police.”
“And tell them what?” he called out, confused.
“That you’re trespassing,” I said loudly. And then realized how weak I
sounded. Don’t be a pussy, I heard Ryan Vaughn admonish me, and blushed
at the memory, ashamed that I could sound like this.
“You’re crazy,” Robert said. “Just open up. Or come out here. We can
talk by the pool.”
I slowly moved toward the kitchen door and unlocked it. I pushed it
open.
“I know what happened in Chicago,” I said. “What do you want?”
“This whole thing has got to stop.” He ignored the remark about Chicago
and didn’t make any move to enter the house. “I mean you’ve got to get a
grip, dude.”
“What whole thing?” I asked. “What whole thing has to stop?”
“This thing you have about me,” he said. “Your version of who you think
I am.” He paused, and then for emphasis added, “It’s going to get both of us
in a lot of trouble.”
“What’s the version, Robert?” I asked. “Oh, fuck it,” I said turning away.
“I don’t care anymore. You’re going to do what you’re going to do. I can’t
stop you. You got Susan, whatever.”
I walked over to the hallway leading to my room. I turned and waited to
see what he was going to do.
Robert hesitantly entered the kitchen and then stood next to the island in
the middle of the space. He was concerned, on the verge of worry but, like
me, capable of calmness, and acting as if nothing bothered him, except you
could see the whirring behind the eyes and intuit from this that Robert was
locked into a kind of madness he’d never escape.
“Yeah, Susan and I are together,” he said. “I’m sorry if that bothers you.”
“No, you’re not,” I said. “You’re not sorry about anything.”
And then he suddenly asked, “Did you break into my house? The house
on Benedict?” He paused, staring at me—I was shocked by the way he
referred to it as my house. “Did you go through my things?” He was asking
this sincerely with traces of confusion. “Were you there? How did you find
out about it?”
“No,” I said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Robert just stared, trying to figure out whether he believed me or not.
He sighed and started walking toward me.
“You’re all alone here?” he asked softly. “Tonight? There’s no one else
here?”
I nodded and didn’t realize I was backing down the hallway until I
passed the door to the garage, where I thought about simply bolting, but the
keys to the Mercedes were in my bedroom.
“What do you want?” I asked.
“Who do you think I am?” he asked back.
I couldn’t help myself. It came automatically. “I think…you’re
connected to the Trawler,” I said quietly. “I think you’re responsible for…
those girls…”
“Stop it, Bret,” he said in a soft voice.
I kept backing down the hallway. He kept slowly heading toward me.
“You’re the Trawler,” I whispered. “And I think you did something to
Debbie.”
“Your girlfriend,” he said. “Why would I do something to your
girlfriend?”
“I don’t know,” I whispered. “But I think you did something to her.”
“Your girlfriend?” Robert asked.
“Yeah, my girlfriend.”
“The one you’re so serious about.”
“Yeah,” I whispered. “I think you did something to her.”
“Stop it,” he said tiredly. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Where are you keeping her?” I asked. “Are you keeping her at Benedict
Canyon?”
“Are you one of the freaks that keep following me?” he countered. “Is
that you, Bret? Are you with them? Did they contact you?”
“I don’t know…who you’re talking about,” I barely managed to say.
“Did they contact you?” he asked. “Are you with them now?”
“You were at the Village Theater,” I said. “You were with Katherine
Latchford the week she disappeared…You lied…”
“So what?” he asked with a confidence that I found chilling. “What does
that prove?” He paused. “Maybe you were the creep who started following
us. Maybe you were the creep she said was staring at her in the parking lot.”
“I have that tape you left,” I said, ignoring him. “The one with you and
Matt on it—”
“I didn’t leave you a tape, Bret.”
I realized I didn’t want to play the tape for Robert and have to reach into
the drawer where Matt’s underwear was—and it didn’t matter, since it
implicated me far more than anyone else. We were in my room now and he
was standing in front of me. I didn’t know what to say anymore, because
there was nothing else to say—nothing registered with him, it was like
talking into a mirror. He studied me for a moment and then cocked his head.
He looked around the room, taking it in; his eyes landed on the Elvis Costello
poster. The room was silent. He suddenly grinned and looked away and then
back at me, almost shyly. He slowly reached out a hand and I slapped at it,
shocked that he was going to touch me.
“Shhh,” he said. “Just calm down. Just relax.”
I backed away but my legs hit the bed and I lost my balance and sat
there.
And then he was standing over me and I was staring at the bulge of his
crotch encased in the tight gray slacks. He reached out and lightly ruffled my
hair and a bolt of lust ignited within me. He lowered his hand and then he
was tracing my jaw and then lightly the side of my neck and then the hand
was back on my cheek, stroking it. I was trembling. He looked at me with a
distant expression, almost lost, as if he couldn’t figure out why he was doing
this but was compelled to anyway. “Relax,” he said again and his thumb
stopped on my lips and then he lightly tried pushing it into my mouth. He
finally pushed the thumb in and out of my mouth and I let him—it tasted
salty and felt rough and I sucked on it like a cock and I wanted to suck his
other fingers. He stopped and leaned down into my face and his lips lightly
touched mine and then he pressed harder. I was instantly stiff as he lowered
himself onto the bed and lay on top of me, his mouth on mine, and then he
started grinding his hips against me, and I was grinding back, remembering
him naked by the pool of Susan’s house—his big dick, the taut ass. “Yeah,
you like that?” he whispered huskily, his breath milky and wet, and then he
started kissing me harder, his tongue pushing into my mouth, and I became
overwhelmed and started fiercely kissing him back and my cock had gotten
so hard I thought I was on the verge of orgasm and my face was so red it was
burning and Robert noticed how hard I was and stopped pumping his crotch
and grinned, his face inches from mine and whispered, “You like that, don’t
you?” I nodded and could smell his breath, his scent. I had my hands clasped
on the cheeks of his small tight ass, kneading them, spreading them apart
beneath the gray slacks and the jockey shorts. I couldn’t control my
breathing. My penis was so hard now it actually hurt. I had opened my legs
and spread them wide and I reached down to unbutton my bathing suit and
pulled my cock out. He looked down at the pulsing erection and then back at
me and whispered, “Yeah, stroke it.” I had barely started touching myself
when I realized I was going to ejaculate and stopped and reached for his cock
instead but I couldn’t find it and then realized Robert wasn’t hard.
I looked up at his face and the sexy grin was gone and he pushed back
and sat on the edge of the bed and then looked down at me and with a faint
trace of disgust wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and muttered,
“Fucking faggot.” And then, “I knew it.”
—
I LAY there immobile as he stood up and then he just stared out the bay
window at the darkened yard, the trees lit by ground lamps, the glowing blue
rectangle of the pool and the black canyons below winding all the way down
to where the lights of the Valley began. I don’t know how long he stood there
—time didn’t exist for me in that moment. He squinted at something and then
whispered to himself—I couldn’t hear what it was—and then without looking
at me he simply turned and left the bedroom. I heard his shoes walking along
the hallway and then the front door opened and then it closed and he was
gone. I couldn’t help myself and within seconds I came so hard the force of it

THE FOLLOWING was culled together from various police reports,
eyewitness accounts and testimonials concerning what happened on Saturday
night, November 7, 1981.
Susan Reynolds made plans with Robert Mallory for him to arrive at the
house on North Canon Drive at eight o’clock. Donald and Gayle Reynolds
would be out to dinner with friends, actually at Le Dome, where Susan had
suggested Robert celebrate his eighteenth birthday—it was that night, and
Robert and Susan were going to spend it together in her bedroom watching
TV, maybe The Love Boat, and then maybe Fantasy Island, maybe Saturday
Night Live; Lauren Hutton was hosting. Maybe Robert would stay the night,
maybe he wouldn’t; nothing was decided. Regardless, Susan and Robert
would have the house to themselves until about eleven, when Donald and
Gayle returned home—they were meeting another couple for cocktails at a
house on Maple Drive before heading to the restaurant for a seven-thirty
reservation.
At around seven-fifteen Susan took a shower and put on a white terrycloth robe and began getting ready for Robert’s arrival. She was listening to
music—“Private Eyes” by Hall and Oates, she remembered—in front of the
mirror at her dressing table while blowing her hair dry when she thought she
heard something: a “slamming” noise downstairs in the empty house. But she
couldn’t be sure. She turned off the blow-dryer and sat still, listening. She
leaned over and lowered the volume on the stereo. She was still anxious
about Debbie’s disappearance—no one had heard from her since she was last
seen on Thursday night, no phone calls, her car wasn’t found—and the
Valium she’d taken earlier wasn’t sufficiently calming. She sat in her chair
and waited, staring at her face in the lit mirror, willing herself to calm down.
She reached for the phone and called Robert, but he didn’t pick up, which
meant he was either taking a shower or maybe had already left Century City
and was heading over earlier than planned. She resumed drying her hair and
didn’t turn the volume back on. Five minutes later Susan heard what she
thought was another “slamming” noise coming from downstairs and she
turned off the blow-dryer and automatically called out, “Mom? Dad?”—she
realized it was too early for Robert and she would have had to let him in
since he didn’t have a key, so who else could it have been? Susan convinced
herself in that moment that nothing was downstairs when she didn’t hear
anything else. But she became distracted and decided to see what it was she’d
actually heard.
—
SUSAN couldn’t shake it off: she had an “uneasy feeling,” as if there was “a
presence” inside the house while she made her way downstairs. She didn’t
think about calling the police at first: Robert would be there soon and what
could possibly happen to her in a mansion on North Canon Drive on a
Saturday night in Beverly Hills, is what she was thinking. She’d always been
safe, protected, taken care of, nothing could happen to her, she wasn’t
reckless like Debbie, she was in control. Susan convinced herself that she
was being silly and at that point she was sufficiently unafraid. In the living
room the phone rang, startling her, and it kept ringing until she picked it up
and said “Hello?” and then someone hung up. That’s when she saw that the
sliding glass door leading from the backyard into the dining room was wide
open. Susan walked over to the door, curious, and stared out into the
darkened yard. She thought the pool lights had been turned on earlier but the
pool was just a long black rectangle and the Christmas lights from her party,
lacing the massive bougainvillea, were darkened as well. Again she couldn’t
be sure if the backyard had been lit before she’d taken the shower. And that
was when Susan imagined she saw a figure standing next to the tree—though
after a few seconds she realized that maybe no one was there. Maybe she had
imagined it, she thought—it was so dark. But at this point Susan made the
decision to wait outside the house for Robert, in her car, even though she
really had no idea if the sliding glass door had been open earlier, before her
parents left for dinner, or not. She slid the glass door closed and a wave of
apprehension swept over her even though she told herself she was just keyed
up, anxious because of Debbie; maybe she needed another Valium, maybe
she just needed to see Robert, she was sad about Thom.
She remembered to lock the door before she walked away from it.
—
SUSAN DIDN’T get dressed—she was just going to pull the BMW out of the
garage and park on the curb and wait for Robert to arrive. This was all so
silly, she thought, but she didn’t want to stay in the house any longer. Still
wearing her robe, she walked out to the garage and got into the car, but it
wouldn’t start. She turned the key in the ignition: the BMW revved up and
then made a sputtering sound and died out. This happened three times before
the car wouldn’t start at all. (Later it would be discovered that the motor oil
had been drained and replaced with a mixture of salt and Pepsi; a crushed can
was discarded in one of the trash bins in the garage.) Her parents had taken
Gayle’s Mercedes to dinner; Donald’s Cadillac was in the garage, but back
inside the house Susan couldn’t find the keys. She told herself to calm down
and had just walked upstairs to her room to quickly get dressed so she could
stand on the bluestone pathway lined with the Mexican fan palms and wait
for Robert when she heard something downstairs—it was the sliding glass
door being slammed open again. She was positive about this—she wasn’t
imagining it. And then she realized: she had locked it.
Someone had opened it from within the house.
And that’s when Susan called Thom Wright. Thom was in his bedroom
on North Hillcrest and he picked up when he heard Susan’s voice on the
answering machine. She told him that she was frightened and that there was
something wrong and could Thom please forget everything and please come
over please. Thom listened silently and was about to hang up on her—he was
furious that she had called and asked him this. “Where’s Robert? Why don’t
you call him?” And Susan whispered back: “There’s someone in the house.”
And then the line went dead.
—
SUSAN THOUGHT that Thom had hung up on her but when she tried to call
him back she realized that someone had cut the phone lines. Susan now knew
that something was very wrong and moved quickly down the upstairs
hallway, still in her robe and barefoot, and arrived at the top of the stairs and
was looking into the stark white-lit living room, at least the half she could
see. She carefully stepped down until she was midway between the upstairs
and the first floor, and then she saw something. It was a person standing very
still in the middle of the vast white space, wearing black jeans and a longsleeved black T-shirt and a black ski mask. It seemed to be waiting for her. A
black-gloved hand was clutching a butcher knife. There was a moment of
confusion where Susan and the intruder just stared at each other. His eyes
were unusually wide and his mouth was open and baring his teeth. The weird
pause continued until the figure lunged toward her.
Susan turned, screaming, and fell against the stairs as the intruder leapt
on her and then dragged her by a leg to the bottom of the staircase. She
kicked at him and her robe opened—she was only wearing panties beneath it
—and then the “thing” straddled her, pressing her down on the floor and
staring at her breasts. The eyes remained wide and the mouth was a grimace
—and then it was opening and closing as if the intruder couldn’t help it, as if
he was trying to form sentences but couldn’t make any sounds, and then
Susan registered the butcher knife again and it was almost as if the intruder
remembered he was holding it as well and he lowered it until the tip of the
knife ran across the upper band of her panties and Susan involuntarily
grabbed at the blade to stop it, slicing her hand open while the intruder kept
the knife pressed hard against her vagina; blood from Susan’s palm started
seeping out and immediately stained the panties and then the intruder lifted
the knife and swiped it hard across her chest, slicing into Susan’s right breast,
slitting it wide open. The knife was so sharp that she didn’t realize what had
happened at first and when she looked down she was confused: there was a
hot red sheet coating her torso. And then she realized: it was blood. The
breast had collapsed, it sagged open, and a flap of flesh hung against her
chest, and then the pain caused her to start screaming again.
—
ON HILLCREST, THOM ran to his Corvette in only a bathing suit and a Tshirt and he was barefoot. He raced the car along Elevado, speeding through
every stop sign until he hit Canon and then swerved left, braking the car into
a skid on the driveway, and ran to the front door, which was locked; he could
hear Susan screaming from inside the house. He ran around to the back of the
residence, where the sliding glass door was open, and found Susan in the
living room, sitting on the floor, hunched over, her robe drenched with blood.
Thom was suddenly paralyzed; he couldn’t register what was happening.
When Susan looked up and saw Thom she screamed, “He’s in here!” She
screamed it again, “He’s in here!” Thom didn’t know what he was looking
for or what she meant. “He’s in here!” she screamed. “He’s in here!” And
then he saw it.
The figure wearing a ski mask, holding a butcher knife, smeared with
blood, rushing toward Thom while Susan kept screaming as the intruder and
Thom fell to the floor. The intruder quickly sat up, repositioned himself,
raised the knife and automatically plunged it into Thom’s left buttock as
Thom lay on his side and then immediately slashed downward, sawing the
flesh open as it sliced down the leg, blood spraying out, all the way to the
knee, the entire meat of it folded open, peeling away from the rest of the leg.
The knife had missed the femoral artery but blood was pouring onto the white
marble floor in a quickly widening pool. Thom started screaming.
And then the intruder turned to Susan; she tried to scramble up but the
figure grabbed her from behind and held her in place with his arm crooked
around her neck. For some reason Susan left the following detail out of the
initial police reports: she instinctively grabbed the arm with both hands and
moved her chin down and forced her mouth onto the sleeve of the intruder
and bit hard onto his forearm and wouldn’t let go. She tasted blood as the
intruder tried to pull his arm away from her grip—the intruder was shouting
out in pain—until he stabbed her in the arm and she finally let go. He reeled
away and hesitated before striking her across the face with a gloved fist and
she fell backward onto the floor. Susan’s mouth was filled with blood—she
had bitten so deeply into the forearm that she could feel hard flecks of flesh
in her mouth that she started spitting out—this detail was told to someone
five days later. The intruder fled through the open sliding glass door and
disappeared into the darkness of the backyard.
—
SUSAN CRAWLED through the massive pool of blood in the living room to
where Thom was sheet-white and bleeding out, shaking uncontrollably, and
then she lifted herself and shambled toward the phone and picked it up but
she had forgotten that the lines had been cut and the phone was dead and she
lunged out the front door of the house screaming for help. She crossed over
the yard and out onto Canon, her robe drenched in blood, the deflated breast
flapping against her chest; her entire torso was painted red and streaked with
tissue, and her panties were sopping with blood as well, her face smeared
with it. And then she whirled around when the headlights of Robert’s Porsche
suddenly blinded her and he braked the car and ran to where Susan had
collapsed in the street and she shouted at him, weeping, that Thom was
inside: he was bleeding, he was dying, you have to save him. Robert ran into
the house as horrified neighbors began emerging from their homes on North
Canon. Someone had called the police but Robert came out of the house
carrying Thom, who was losing consciousness, his mangled leg looking
“unreal” according to one witness—cleaved open, part of it “hanging off” the
side—and he didn’t wait for the police or an ambulance. Robert placed Thom
in the front seat of the Porsche and then Susan got in, squeezing next to
Thom. Robert drove to the closest hospital, which was Cedars, racing along
Santa Monica Boulevard, swerving recklessly in and out of traffic, and then
down to Beverly, where the Porsche lurched into the emergency parking area
and where Robert ran in shouting for help. A group of attendants immediately
wheeled gurneys out and placed Thom, now unconscious, on one and a
hysterical Susan on the other, and then she grabbed Robert’s arm before she
was taken into the emergency OR and told him to call Le Dome and page her
parents, which Robert did from a phone at the nurses’ station, and Donald
and Gayle arrived at Cedars twenty minutes later.
—
I HAD PACKED a bag and was moving to a motel on Sepulveda Boulevard
not far from the Sherman Oaks Galleria—I wasn’t going to risk it and spend
another night in the house on Mulholland—when the phone in my bedroom
rang at nine and it was Donald Reynolds. In a stunned voice he explained that
Susan and Thom had been attacked by an intruder at the house on Canon
Drive and said, “Susan told me to call you on this number and she wanted me
to tell you that she’s worried about you. She wants you to know that
someone’s out there. That maybe you guys, I don’t know, have all been
targeted…by someone…That’s what she said…” I automatically asked where
Robert Mallory was and Donald quickly filled me in on what Robert had told
him when he found Thom and Susan and that Robert was the one who had
driven them to Cedars. Thom was in surgery and he was barely going to
make it and Laurie Wright had just arrived and was in shock. All I could ask,
standing numb in my bedroom, was “Is Robert still there?” I waited. “Um,
no, he left. He went back to Century City,” Donald said. “There was no
reason for him to stay. He already talked to the police. He said that—” I
thanked Donald and hung up on him in mid-sentence.
—
LATER, ACCORDING TO the valet and the front desk at the Century
Towers, Robert was last seen walking into the lobby at eight-fifty, his clothes
and face covered with dried blood and a black duffel bag slung over his
shoulder, and he was trying not to weep but also assured the doorman that he
was okay and that there had been a “terrible accident” he witnessed and that
he was going to clean up before going back to the hospital. I drove the Jaguar
to Century City and stopped at the valet beyond the gates of the Century
Towers and said that Robert Mallory had called and that he needed to see me.
“I rushed straight over,” I said. “I go to school with him. I’m a friend. I have
no idea what he wants. He sounded…desperate.” The valet gravely nodded—
he had seen the condition Robert was in when he had arrived thirty minutes
ago—and motioned me to a parking space directly by the fountains in front of
the entrance but didn’t tell me to check in with the doorman. I guessed he
assumed I just would. I got out of the car and walked quickly to the lobby and
paused, glancing over for a moment at the faraway front desk, behind which
the lone doorman was situated. I just decided to risk it and walked directly to
the other side of the lobby and stepped into an elevator and pressed “28.”
—
I USED THE KEY I had found in the room Robert occupied in the
abandoned house on Benedict Canyon and quietly opened the front door of
Abigail’s condo.
The recessed lighting in the living room was dimmed, accentuating the
massive views of West Hollywood and the hills above Sunset braided with
lights, and Pico Boulevard was sparse with traffic on that Saturday night.
Everything seemed so far away that the world in that moment felt unreal and
I acted accordingly. I bolted the door shut and then quickly dismantled the
doorknob with the pair of pliers I was carrying, wrenching the handle off the
door, rendering the door useless, it couldn’t be opened—the process was
louder than I intended, making a screeching sound that echoed throughout the
apartment when I finally pulled the knob off and it clattered to the floor. I
expected Robert to run out from wherever he was to see what had caused the
noise coming from the entrance hall but he didn’t. And then I proceeded into
the kitchen, where I pulled a knife out of the countertop block. I unplugged
the phone and yanked out the cord from the wall and then made my way past
Robert’s bedroom, where I heard the shower running, and went into Abigail’s
bedroom and unplugged the line to that phone as well, removed the cord and
placed it in the nightstand, and then I moved down the darkened hallway
toward Robert’s bedroom.
The shower in the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom was running and I
made my way toward the sound of the water as if solely guided by it. I stood
in the doorway of the bedroom and saw the black duffel bag sitting on the
gray comforter of the bed and it was in the process of being packed—Tshirts, underwear, a pair of jeans, a toiletries kit. And then I saw the tennis
shorts and yellow Polo shirt stained with blood that Robert had been wearing
earlier now lying in a pile by the bed, along with a pair of underwear and
white blood-spattered Topsiders. There was no other sound in the apartment
except for the water streaming from the shower Robert was taking. I moved
slowly into the bathroom, which was shrouded in steam, and simply neared
the shower stall and slowly reached toward the chrome handle with the fist
holding the knife. When I opened the door the stall was empty. I stared at the
hot water blasting out of the showerhead, confused.
And then I heard someone shout my name behind me and I screamed and
whirled around.
—
ROBERT’S HAIR WAS WET and he was only wearing jockey shorts and a
white T-shirt and I realized he’d been crouching behind the bed when I
walked in and was now standing on the other side of it, directly across from
me. We stared at each other in what seemed like a mutually surprised state of
shock. I looked down and saw that he was clenching a butcher knife in his
fist. And then he saw the knife I was holding. I remembered what my motives
were: I wanted to talk to him. I wanted him to confess.
“What were those noises?” he asked. “What did you do?”
“I didn’t do anything, Robert,” I said softly.
“How did you get in, Bret?” he asked in a calm steely voice. But I could
tell he was unnerved and trying not to show it. “What are you doing here?
How did you get up? What were those noises?”
It took me a moment to find my voice again. I hadn’t expected this to be
part of the narrative: the shower, the knife, Robert hiding behind the bed.
“I…just wanted to talk to you…” I said softly. “I just wanted to make sure I
could talk to you…”
“Why are you holding a knife, Bret?” he asked calmly.
“Susan and Thom were…attacked tonight,” I said.
“Why are you holding a knife, Bret?” he asked again.
“It was…you, right?” I said. “You…tried to…hurt…” I couldn’t finish
the sentence.
“I found them,” Robert said. “I took them to the hospital. You didn’t
answer me. Why are you holding a knife, Bret?”
I ignored him and breathed in and carefully said, “I want to know what
you did with Debbie—”
“Get the fuck out of here,” he said softly.
“Where is she?” I asked.
He hadn’t moved. He just stood behind the bed, very still. “I don’t know
where she is, Bret.”
“I…don’t think that’s true,” I said softly.
“I don’t care what you think is true,” he said. “But I’m going to take you
downstairs to the lobby and I’m going to have the doorman escort you out of
here—”
“No, you’re not,” I said.
He paused and tried not to appear shocked by my tone.
“What do you mean—no, I’m not?” he asked.
“You’re going to tell me where Debbie Schaffer is,” I said. “And then
we’re going to call the police.” I paused. “You need help, Robert. You’re
sick. And you need help.” I stared at him.
Robert didn’t say anything. He just stood frozen, clutching the butcher
knife. He had put the jockey shorts and T-shirt on when he was still wet and
there were oval outlines where the dampness had touched the fabric. The
almond eyes squinted slightly and he realized something. “You’re with them,
aren’t you?” he said softly.
“With who, Robert?” I asked, as if speaking to a child.
“You’re one of them,” he said, softly convincing himself.
“I just want you to tell me where Debbie is,” I said. “And I just want you
to get help.”
“You’re one of the freaks who’ve been following me,” Robert
murmured, staring at my face, and then his eyes were roaming my body.
“Ever since that summer…after the movie…when it started…” He trailed off
as if lost in a reverie. “You were there…”
“I don’t know who you’re talking about, Robert,” I said.
“You’re with them, aren’t you?” he said in a trance. He slowly took a
step back. “The freak who follows me.”
“Robert, tell me where Debbie is,” I said, straining.
“You’re one of them,” he said. “You’re one of the freaks who’ve been
following me. Just fucking admit it, Bret.”
“I’m not one of them, Robert,” I said. “I just want to talk to you about
where Debbie is.”
“Get the fuck out of here,” he said. “Get the fuck away from me.”
Something was rising in the room. This couldn’t stay sustained—it was
looking for a release. The building up toward it was becoming intolerable.
Everything felt pressurized.
“I just want to help you,” I said again. And then I started slowly moving
around the bed to where he stood. “Where’s Debbie? Where did you take
her?”
“Get away from me.” He made a sudden movement: he swiped the
butcher knife through the air. And then he leapt onto the bed, where he
towered over me as he carefully balanced on the mattress. I turned direction
and stared up at him from where I stood.
“Where’s Debbie, Robert?” I said, my voice rising.
“Get out of here,” he shouted. “You’re with them! Get the fuck out!”
“Where’s Debbie?” I shouted back.
In that moment Robert leapt forward and slashed the knife at me and I
felt the tip of it across my face, opening up my forehead and cheekbone.
Before I could react he slashed again and I could feel it slice across my nose
and lips. Blood started dripping down my face and I had to blink it out of my
eyes. I blindly stumbled forward with my knife raised but Robert had run out
of the room and I collapsed against the sink in the bathroom but couldn’t see
my reflection because there was too much steam—the water was still pouring
out of the shower. I wiped my face off with a hand towel I grabbed by the
sink and looked at it as I walked back into the bedroom. It had immediately
been stained red. I turned it over and pressed it against my face again and the
other side came back just as red. I held the towel up against my forehead to
stop the blood from dripping into my eyes as I moved into the hallway.
—
I COULD HEAR the grunting noises of panic coming from Robert as he tried
to open the front door of the apartment. “What did you do?!?” he screamed.
“What in the fuck did you do?” I kept the towel held against my forehead as I
moved toward the living room. I heard him run into the kitchen and fumble
with the disconnected phone, which he threw against the floor. There were
animal noises of fear coming from him as he started to pound on the front
door again, his arms slamming against it. “Help!” he shouted. “Help!”
“Robert,” I said, moving toward the darkness of the living room. “I just
want to talk.”
Suddenly there was silence. I pulled the towel from my forehead and
scanned the space but couldn’t locate Robert. He wasn’t by the front door and
he wasn’t in the kitchen. I walked carefully by the dining table and the
granite fireplace and the Hockney print. The bleeding had slowed down—
blood wasn’t dripping into my eyes anymore—but I could taste it on my lips
and my face was wet with it. I was about to call his name again when he
suddenly emerged from the darkness at an angle I hadn’t expected and
pushed me back against a wall and then lifted his arm and stabbed me in the
chest, but the knife hit the breast bone, which only caused the blade to drag
down, slicing across the pectoral, and I could feel blood draping across my
abdomen. I automatically pushed Robert away and then slashed wildly at him
with the knife: a large red line was suddenly swiped across his chest and his
rib cage and down to his torso—the white T-shirt flowered red. It wasn’t
deep but blood started spattering across the marble floor. He lunged forward
and tried to stab me again in the chest and again it didn’t go deeper than the
breastbone—this all happened in a matter of seconds. I pushed him away and
fell against the wall and turned toward it, sliding, shocked not only at how
much blood was smearing across the white expanse but also that it was my
blood.
—
ROBERT WAS opening the sliding glass door that led out to the balcony and
I rushed toward him and slashed the knife across his back. He turned and
lifted a leg to kick me away—and I fell backward onto the floor. When he
returned to the door and opened it I could see that his back was now red with
blood. He fully opened the sliding glass door and stepped onto the balcony
and then slammed the door shut, holding on to it, while shouting for help. He
kept holding on, because he couldn’t lock it from outside, and he kept
shouting for help while I started to pry the glass door open. He pushed
against it, holding the door in place. I immediately stepped away from the
door and kicked at it hard. And then I kicked it again. Robert kept holding it
in place, shouting for help, red-faced. His ripped T-shirt was now covered
completely with blood and blood was spattering all over the smooth whitetiled floor of the balcony. I brushed from my eyes drops of blood that were
dripping down my forehead again. Robert kept shouting for help, now in a
crouch, still holding on to the door handle—but he was so far above the
world, who could have possibly heard him? I kicked the door again and the
glass finally cracked. I kept kicking and the crack splintered upward. Robert
kept shouting for help while holding on to the door, his muscles straining,
blood running down his legs. I kicked again and the entire door burst open in
a cascading sheet of glass that littered the balcony.
Robert backed away and looked over the railing. I thought he was going
to jump and rushed toward him with the knife and knocked him onto the
balcony floor and held him there, straddling his waist. He was writhing
against the shattered glass and it was cutting into my knees as I tried to grab
the wrist with the hand holding the knife but he managed to stab my thigh,
digging the blade in and then pulling it out and pushing it in again, and I
screamed and rolled off him onto the carpet of broken glass and I could feel it
cutting into my back and neck. I clutched Robert’s forearm and slammed it
down onto the glass and forced it up, then slammed it down, trying to knock
the knife out of his grasp. He managed to pull away and grabbed the railing
with a hand encrusted with broken glass and then I watched in horror as he
climbed onto it.
“Robert,” I shouted. “Don’t.”
He crouched on the railing and threw the knife over it and then lifted one
leg and then another while gripping the railing and then he dropped out of
sight.
I screamed and crawled to the railing, momentarily forgetting the broken
glass that was cutting into my knees and palms, and looked down.
—
ROBERT HAD DROPPED onto the lit balcony below, which jutted out four
feet past the railing on the top floor of the Century Towers. I heard Robert
pounding on the sliding glass door of the unit and calling out for help but no
one was answering, it was locked, the lights inside were off, nobody was
home. Waves of adrenaline were shooting through me as I climbed onto the
railing, slippery with blood, and pretended that I wasn’t twenty-eight stories
up and that it was a miniature world below me and that none of this was real
and, still clutching the knife, I easily landed on the lit balcony, maybe a drop
of eight feet. I rushed toward Robert, who was slick and shiny with blood,
and pulled him away from pounding on the sliding glass door now streaked
red as he shouted desperately into the darkened apartment beyond it, and I
started shaking him, screaming into his face, “WHERE IS SHE WHERE IS
DEBBIE?” I didn’t feel it when he stabbed me in the arm—the blade didn’t
go deep enough to register at first. He was screaming back at me, What did
you want what do you want from me why were you following me? He was
delirious with fear and anger and there was shattered glass stuck along his
legs and arms and after holding me back he lunged at me, swinging the knife,
and I could feel the blade tear through my shirt and slash my chest again. I
clumsily ran the blade of my knife across his bare arm and blood started
pouring out. With the same arm he clenched his fist and punched the side of
my head with such force that I fell to my knees stunned. I saw white for a
moment and I could feel my eyes roll back into my sockets as I staggered to
my knees. I felt wet with blood everywhere.
I looked down at the blood-splattered patio and then lifted my head—I
thought I was going to be sick when I saw Robert climb over the railing on
the twenty-seventh floor but I lurched forward and grabbed his leg and pulled
him toward me. He fell back onto the patio and started kicking at my face and
I held on to his calf to steady him but he managed to land the heel of his foot
against my cheek. His T-shirt and underwear completely stained red with
blood, he heaved himself up and straddled me while I lay there, everything
blurry and echoing around me, and I felt his hands on my throat, and they
were slowly crushing it. But the hands were too wet with blood and slippery
and he couldn’t get the proper traction, apply the correct pressure, and I was
able to reach up with the hand holding the knife and blindly stab him. One
hand let go of my throat and he knocked the knife out of my fist and it
clattered against the bloodied balcony. The moment the knife flew away I
grabbed his throat with both my hands and pulled him closer to me until we
were face to face. He strained upward, pulling away, and then scrambled off
me and turned to grip the railing.
—
I HEAVED myself up, choking, and stopped him from climbing onto it. We
were now leaning, half over the railing, in an embrace and I realized he was
trying to throw me off the balcony. I could smell the coppery aroma of blood
everywhere and it was so quiet and what happened between us had only been
going on for barely two minutes—it all happened so fast—but I was fading.
We stayed locked in a frozen grip—neither one could move the other. I was
suddenly so exhausted that Robert was able to finally push away from me and
grabbed the railing again: I just stared and realized he was going to jump onto
the balcony below this one. And in a matter of seconds he swung over and
hung from the railing and was trying to swing onto the twenty-sixth-story
balcony. But it was the same size as this one—only the twenty-eighth floor
had the smaller balcony. I crawled over to the railing, where just Robert’s
hands were visible, the knuckles not covered with blood white from the
strain. The floor of the balcony was wet, as if it had rained or been hosed
down with water, but it was our blood and I slipped in it while I staggered to
the railing and then, on my knees, looked down and watched as Robert tried
to swing his body onto the twenty-sixth floor.
“Robert, please, I want to help,” I shouted. “Robert, don’t!”
And then I raised a bloodied fist and brought it down on the back of his
hand.
He was making desperate panting sounds. He kept swinging his body
forward, trying to aim for the balcony.
I raised my fist again and brought it down on the back of his other hand,
hard.
“Robert, don’t!” I cried.
And then he fell silently into the darkness.
—
THERE WAS ONLY SILENCE—no screaming—and then an awful
cracking sound when the body hit the roof of the garage that you could hear
twenty-seven stories up. I looked down but I couldn’t see anything. I started
weeping and collapsed into a corner of the patio and soon I could hear the
sirens in the distance. I stayed crouched on the blood-smeared tiles, clutching
myself. At one point I heard the front door being rammed open in the unit
above. There were voices. I started crying out for help. And then the lights in
the darkened unit on the twenty-seventh floor illuminated the empty
apartment and the voices neared me. I was crying nonsensically—the smell
of rust was everywhere but that was the congealing blood. The sliding glass
doors opened but I was blinded with blood and couldn’t really see anything
and I was hysterical. “I tried to help him he killed himself he was my friend I
loved him I loved him I tried to save him he attacked two of my friends earlier
he jumped he jumped.” I was being lifted up. “He trapped me in the
apartment I thought he was going to kill me.” Paramedics placed me on a
stretcher, my face was wiped clean, and an oxygen mask covered my nose
and mouth. I was wheeled through the apartment and then was carried down
in the elevator. I saw the vaulted ceiling of the lobby as I kept ranting even
though no one could hear me through the oxygen mask. “He killed those girls
he killed Debbie he attacked Susan he told me to come he needed me he
attacked me he tried to kill me before he jumped I loved him I loved him.” I
was pleading to anyone who was listening. I was wheeled into the courtyard,
whirling with blue and red lights, sirens piercing the air, and the last thing I
saw before losing consciousness was another stretcher being slowly wheeled
toward an ambulance, two paramedics by its side, and on it was something
completely misshapen, a mound, something that had rearranged itself when it
hit the roof of the Century Towers garage and become something else and the
sheet covering it was stained with red and purple and yellow—it was some
kind of sculpture, sections of it sticking upward beneath the sheet: it was
something that couldn’t have fit into a body bag. And when I realized that
under the sheet were the remains of Robert I started screaming until I blacked
out.
31
I WAS IN A DARKENED room in Cedars-Sinai and Laurie Wright was
standing over me when I woke up in the middle of the night.
There were actually no serious injuries, though I received 115 stitches.
The stab wounds Robert Mallory inflicted upon me weren’t deep or
“invasive” enough for serious medical attention, I was told by a physician.
Besides the light slashing across my face—which didn’t require stitches—I
was stabbed in the breastbone, in the left thigh, in the arm and slashed across
my chest numerous times. I learned it was difficult to get stabbed deeply in a
knife fight. I learned it’s hard to inflict a lethal injury. I learned it is hard to
“get by” the rib cage. I learned you have to stab in a very specific way and at
a very specific angle for the wound to be fatal. None of my organs were
touched and none of my major blood vessels were punctured. I might have
arrived in the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai a bloodied mess, but there
was nothing remotely lethal about my injuries. In retrospect everything felt
vaguely routine, as if I’d been rehearsing this for a long time: I told the police
what had happened to me in Unit 2802 of the Century Towers and there was
no one to refute it. I said that Robert had called me after he left the hospital
from a pay phone “somewhere” and that he was “extremely upset” and that
he needed to see me. I told the police that I knew he had mental issues and
had spent time in an institution in Illinois after a suicide attempt in January
and that I believed he was somehow connected to the crimes of the Trawler,
and that Robert had dated Katherine Latchford in the summer of 1980 before
she vanished, and I explained the time line I had figured out that tied Robert
to the other girls; I also told them I believed Robert was responsible for the
disappearance of Debbie Schaffer—the officers knew nothing about this—
and that it was Robert Mallory, in fact, who had attacked Susan Reynolds and
Thom Wright in the house on North Canon Drive, and after he fled pretended
to rescue them—he was a sick individual, I explained; he was a maniac, I told
them; he wanted to hurt Susan, he had seduced her, this was part of the game;
and he had something to do with the death of Matt Kellner, but no one I
talked to had any idea who that was.
I repeated this story to anyone who would listen: the Reynolds, Laurie
Wright, the police officers who took down my statement, the doctors who
attended to me. I had gone, I told them over and over, to help a “distraught”
friend, someone who had told me on the phone that he was going to kill
himself, and so I “raced” to Century City to try and stop the friend from
committing suicide because I knew he had tried to once before. I was in a
panic, I told them. When I arrived in the apartment I couldn’t find Robert. I
was looking for him in the master bedroom when I heard a noise. And then I
saw that Robert had dismantled the front door—he had bolted it shut and
removed the handle so that I couldn’t open it—to “entrap me” and that I had
defended myself with a knife I found in the kitchen. I kept shouting for help
but apparently no one heard, I said. Even after Robert managed to stab me
several times I tried to pull him off the railings on both the twenty-eighthand twenty-seventh-story balconies while attempting to defend myself. I
reiterated: Robert was mentally unstable. Robert had been in an institution.
He had raped his stepsister. He had attempted suicide once before. He had
killed my friend. I reiterated: I tried to help him. And then he jumped.
All this was taken down with very few questions—when one was asked I
answered it wearily, often tearing up and bursting into sobs—and then I
signed my statements with a bandaged hand that had earlier been encrusted
with shattered glass.

LAURIE WRIGHT told me that my parents had been contacted but they
wouldn’t be back in Los Angeles for two nights due to their complicated and
circuitous route out of Europe. It would take a day for the ship they were
sailing to dock and then they would be driven to the closest airport and fly
into London, where they’d take the Concorde to New York and then barely
make a nonstop American Airlines flight to LAX.
I discharged myself from the hospital late Sunday afternoon—I
demanded it—and Laurie Wright brought me to the house on North Hillcrest,
where I’d be staying until my parents arrived. I was going to sleep in Thom’s
room and Laurie guided me to the bed with the plaid comforter crumpled
across it because I was shuffling stiffly even though the pain pills made me
feel as if I was floating in slow motion, and as I eased myself onto the
mattress I inhaled Thom’s scent—it enveloped me—and I pulled a pillow to
my side and pretended it was him, wincing at the soreness in my chest and
arms and thigh penetrating through the painkillers, and zoned out instead at
the Griffin pennant that hung on the wall over Thom’s desk and its innocence
comforted me. I didn’t really know then the extent—the severity—of Thom’s
injury, only that his leg had been “damaged,” and yet I worried for him and
his future. The pain pills helped me sleep and I didn’t get out of bed until late
Sunday night. There were bandages across my chest and on my right thigh,
but my face, despite the awful red-and-purple swelling where Robert’s kick
had landed, only looked like someone had scratched it when I stared at
myself in the mirror of Thom’s bathroom—there was a very thin scab that ran
down my forehead and there was another one bisecting my nose and lips.
Laurie went back to the hospital and spent the rest of Sunday there as Thom
went through another surgery to put his leg back together, and though he was
briefly conscious and talked to his mother for a moment before he went into
the operating room there was nothing for Laurie Wright to do but wait.
Lionel was flying in from New York on Tuesday and I idly wondered what
had happened to the handsome young man I’d seen Laurie with at
Homecoming, which now seemed like it took place in another world an
eternity ago.
—
I ASKED Laurie how Susan was doing when she came back to the house on
Hillcrest late that evening with some prepared food she had picked up at a
nearby deli before it closed. Laurie shrugged as she opened a bottle of white
wine. “I don’t know, I guess she’s going to be okay,” she said and then
mentioned something about reconstructive surgery and how advanced it had
become. “Reconstructive…surgery?” I asked, confused. Laurie glanced at me
and wouldn’t clarify. “I didn’t see her. She goes home Wednesday.” Laurie
drank the first glass of wine as I sat at the table in the kitchen with her, high,
almost dreaming: I didn’t feel anything, I could barely eat the turkey
sandwich Laurie had brought me, I could barely lift my bandaged hand, and
yet I felt oddly free.
“But it’s hard,” Laurie was saying after pouring herself a second glass of
wine. She paused while contemplating something. “She broke my son’s heart.
I have sympathy for her but I don’t really like her much anymore.”
We watched the ABC local news that night at eleven and the lead story
was about the prep-school boy who leapt to his death from a Century City
high-rise after assaulting a classmate and of course this story was tied to the
attack on Susan and Thom since Robert was connected to both, and briefly,
after my statement was made, there were hints about the Trawler and that if
Robert wasn’t the Trawler there were connections Robert had to the serial
killer that were becoming more apparent after Robert’s suicide. But none of
us knew what these connections were yet.
—
ON MONDAY MORNING before Laurie went to the hospital at nine we
watched the ABC local news during Good Morning America; a dozen squad
cars had descended upon the house on Benedict Canyon late Sunday night,
while we were sleeping. The swirling red and blue lights bathed the house in
a psychedelic wave of color, and the body of Audrey Barbour, the fourth
known victim of the Trawler, was found in a soundproofed room in the
makeshift basement of the house—the room that I had tried to get into but
couldn’t. I sat on the couch in the den on Hillcrest Drive wearing one of
Thom’s robes—dark green with a Polo horse on it, smelling lightly of Aramis
and Old Spice—and stared dully at the TV screen in a Vicodin haze. I was
thinking: this was the house that ate people. I was thinking this was the house
where Matt Kellner had been holed up in for several days while Robert
Mallory tortured him after gaining his trust. This was the house where Robert
Mallory made his awful plans. There was footage of a body bag being carried
out from the side of the house—I recognized the unlocked door I had entered
only days ago. Laurie Wright started crying. It was months later when we
found out what the Trawler meant by the things he referred to in his letters as
“the alterations” and “the assemblages” and “the remakings.” Audrey
Barbour’s sacrificed body was found stapled together with the limbs from a
succession of missing animals by the Trawler and “his friends” who had been
“following the moon”—this was “the project” that the Trawler created, all of
it meticulously sewn together like a patchwork quilt. This was an elaborate
variation on what had also been done to the other three girls, who had also
perhaps spent time in that house.
Inside the space that had been soundproofed by someone in the
abandoned house on Benedict Canyon a sheet of Audrey Barbour’s rotting
flesh that had been removed from her back and shoulders hung in the
doorway like a curtain you had to push aside before you entered the room
where she was being presented: her body had been “decorated”—her mouth
was stuffed with fish, the head and neck of a cat had been splayed across her
forehead and stapled to it, the rest of its body was hanging out of her vagina,
her legs bent and spread as if she was giving birth to it. Audrey’s head was
adorned with the limp bodies of dead snakes, their heads cut off, and a wig of
them crowned her skull. Her breasts were missing—they had been removed
and two cats’ heads had been placed in the empty, mangled wounds. Her anus
was forced open with the snout of a decapitated dog and another dog’s
raggedly mutilated neck was stapled to that. As I’ve said we didn’t learn
about these details until months later, and only a few of them: it took a year
for the awfulness of what the Trawler “accomplished” to be fully revealed.
Even though the body of the fourth victim of the Trawler had been found in
the house on Benedict Canyon, Robert Mallory never appeared as the key
suspect in the days that followed—I later learned that it had been a
“tempting” theory but that certain elements about it simply didn’t add up.

DEBBIE SCHAFFER ARRIVED back at Stone Canyon that Monday
morning, November 9.
She had left Bel Air on Thursday night and driven to the Hollywood
Hills home of a thirty-year-old musician she had been seeing on and off for
the past year, before anything had happened between us, and during our
relationship as well, whose stage name was Shore Lanes; he was the guitarist
in a little-known local band called Line One who were never going to make it
—Susan Reynolds knew about Shore and his was the first place she had
called on Friday morning but Debbie had told anyone who answered the
phone to say that she wasn’t there. Debbie spent the weekend at Shore’s
trying to obliterate from her mind the photos she had seen of her father and
myself on that bed in the Beverly Hills Hotel and she was in a house high
above the city on Appian Way along with various band members and their
groupies in a three-day-long cocaine binge and joined by two girls and a boy,
Riders of the Afterlife kids, all of them seventeen, who the band had
befriended. Debbie hadn’t heard anything about what happened to Susan and
Thom until Monday morning because no one knew where she was or could
contact her and Debbie had wanted it that way. Dealers kept dropping by and
time disappeared, the band rehearsed tracks off a new album that was never
going to be released even though they had received a large advance from the
record company, there was no news from the world outside the rented house,
just a constant supply of cocaine and vodka and tequila, and bowls filled with
Valium and Quaalude, deliveries from the neighborhood liquor store, crates
of beer, cartons of cigarettes, huge bottles of margarita mix—all aiding in
Debbie’s obliteration.
And when Debbie, exhausted, retreated to Shore’s bedroom, the small
TV in the corner was flickering and as she lay on the mattress and stared in a
stupor at its screen, unable to sleep, she realized at one point that she was
staring at Susan Reynolds’s house on North Canon Drive and then a photo of
Robert Mallory from the Roycemore yearbook appeared and Debbie said she
thought she’d been dreaming but then she sat up and in a panic couldn’t find
the remote to turn up the volume. There was footage of the house on Benedict
Canyon swirling with red and blue lights. There was the body bag being
carried out through the side door. There was a shot of TV vans lined up and
down the canyon road. There was a shot of the Century Towers. Yearbook
photos of Thom Wright, Susan Reynolds and Bret Ellis flashed across the
screen. Debbie got dressed and wandered out of the house into the cold light
of morning and, walking the street, it took her thirty minutes to locate her car,
until she remembered it had been hidden in the garage since she didn’t want
anyone to find her, and then she drove across Sunset back to Bel Air. Maria
wailed when she saw Debbie and fell to her knees, and Steven Reinhardt
called Terry at Cedars; he wanted to talk to his daughter but she refused to
speak to him. She also refused to speak to Liz. Debbie instead stoically
listened as Steven told her what had happened—the attack on Susan and
Thom, and later myself and then Robert’s suicide that only I had witnessed.
The first thing Debbie Schaffer asked after a moment of silence while she just
stared impassively at Steven’s face: “A suicide? Is that what Bret said it
was?”
—
I GRABBED MY mother and fell into her arms weeping when she appeared
at Laurie Wright’s house early Tuesday morning to take me back to
Mulholland in a black limousine that was waiting curbside in front of the
residence on North Hillcrest.
—
ON FRIDAY I called Susan and asked if I could see her and she agreed.
I hadn’t been to school that week and I hadn’t talked to anyone except
my mother and someone from the LAPD who wanted to question me again
about what happened in the condo on the twenty-eighth floor of the Century
Towers—Abigail Mallory supposedly had her doubts about my narrative—
but I gave the detective the same story, though embellishing details about
Robert to make it more dramatic and frightening. Again, who was going to
refute it? And I was disappointed that the detective didn’t ask about
Katherine Latchford or Matt Kellner or anything else except the events that
led to the attack in the apartment. I was just sitting outside at a patio table
spacing out on the remainder of the Vicodin next to Marty Reed, my parents’
lawyer, but there really was no physical pain any longer. I spent a lot of time
naked in the bathroom inspecting the wounds Robert Mallory had inflicted
upon me and I’d peel back the bandages and stare at the stitched-up spaces,
fascinated mostly by the long line that began at my breastbone and traveled
down my rib cage: a dark-purple centipede is what I thought it looked like.
I mostly avoided the news about what happened that night, but the
discovery of Audrey Barbour supplanted the attack on Canon Drive and the
suicide in Century City, with the media only nominally connecting Robert
with the Trawler and his crimes—and I couldn’t understand why. There had
been no news at all about Deborah Schaffer: no mention of her disappearance
appeared anywhere and I’m fairly sure Terry and Liz made this happen or
simply hadn’t filed the missing person report. Debbie was simply gone for
the weekend and then she was back at the house on Stone Canyon the
following Monday morning. And she had been the only one Susan allowed in
her bedroom on Canon Drive, where she was recuperating while awaiting
another reconstructive surgery.
—
GAYLE LET ME IN on that Friday afternoon and I walked through the
living room behind her and up the stairs and down the hall to where Susan
was in her bedroom—it had been six days since the attack.
Susan was propped up in bed and Gayle asked her if she needed anything
and Susan shook her head no. Susan was sedated on painkillers, semi-lost in a
medicated daze, and she was listening to Icehouse. She was wearing a robe
but I could see part of the bandage that was wrapped around her chest—it
was impossible not to notice that one side of her was simply flattened out and
I held in a gasp. When we tried hugging each other we both laughed as we
winced with pain and then started crying. I sat down on the bed next to
Susan, and her bandaged hand, where she had grabbed the intruder’s knife,
covered her mouth as tears spilled quickly out of her eyes, and then I bowed
my head and started convulsing with sobs—we didn’t need to acknowledge
what we were both crying over: we knew it was everything, what happened
to Thom, what happened to Robert, the attacks we separately suffered, the
song that was playing, everything. We talked quietly and made promises to
each other. Susan had seen Thom on Wednesday, before she was discharged,
and told me he was going to be okay. I nodded and then started crying again
and she asked if I’d seen anyone and I told her no—I hadn’t been back to
Buckley, I barely left my room, I was high on Vicodin all the time, I probably
shouldn’t have driven over to Beverly Hills. She smiled.
Icehouse kept filtering softly through the room and I realized at one point
there had been a manila envelope resting in Susan’s lap along with a series of
eight-by-ten photos she’d been looking at. I craned my neck as she turned the
photos to me. They were in black and white and seemingly taken with a
telephoto lens: Susan and Robert in Palm Springs at Las Casuelas—this was
from across the street on North Palm Canyon Drive as they sat at a table in
the cantina. Susan and Robert in the backyard of her grandparents’—Robert
in a bathing suit, Susan in a bikini, lounging on a chaise. Susan and Robert
wading in the pool. Susan and Robert standing next to each other by the
white BMW in the senior parking lot—this was taken from somewhere
within the hillsides surrounding Buckley. Everything was taken from far
away, as if the photographer was hiding. Susan: getting out of her BMW and
walking into the Century Towers. Susan: standing alone on Gilley Field
holding a tennis racket. I looked up at her.
“Do you know who took these?” I asked.
She shook her head no. “They were left in the mailbox,” she said
dreamily. I was distracted by the photos and suddenly felt lightly fearful.
Susan was too high to really care. She was just looking at the ones with
Robert in them. “Did you?” she asked slyly. “Did you take them?”
“No.” I shook my head.
“I know you loved me,” she was saying. “And I know you loved Thom.”
I didn’t say anything.
“I hope we never hurt you,” she said.
“No,” I said. “No, you never hurt me.” This wasn’t true but we were past
that place now—it didn’t matter any longer.
“It could have been you,” Susan said. “If things were different.”
Again, I didn’t say anything.
“How did you…” She stopped. “How did you manage to play it so well
all these years?”
“Play what?” I asked, pretending not to know what she meant.
She didn’t say anything until she smiled sadly and looked away. “The
role, Bret.”
“I don’t think I played it so well,” I finally said, my voice cracking.
“I remember the first time I talked to you,” she said, high. “It was the
first week of seventh grade.” She paused. “And it was at lunch and do you
know what I thought?”
I shook my head. The painkillers were talking through her.
“I thought: I’m going to marry him one day,” she said. She grinned,
stoned, studying me for a reaction, curious as to what I might say.
“You’re high,” I said.
“Maybe…”
“What happened?” I asked, playing along. “Why didn’t you?”
“I figured you out,” she said. “I kept you free.”
“Why Robert?” I asked. “I understand Thom, but why Robert?”
“I don’t know,” she said. “I can’t explain it.”
I said nothing.
“I fell in love with him,” she said. “I thought I had met…” She trailed
off, almost ashamed of what she was going to say next. Her mouth was
slightly open, as if she had just received a blow. And then she recovered.
“You thought you met who?” I asked.
There was barely a pause before she said, “A dream.”
I looked down and tried to compose myself.
Susan asked me, “What happened on Saturday night, Bret? In Robert’s
apartment?” She paused. “Tell me what really happened.”
I reached up and placed a finger to her lips and she smiled
understandingly and closed her eyes—the gesture we often made to each
other indicating we didn’t need to hear what the other person was going to
say because we already knew and it wouldn’t make a difference anyway.
When Susan opened her eyes they were automatically drawn to
something. I was wearing a blue Polo dress shirt, long-sleeved, buttoned up,
but one of the sleeves had draped down when I lifted my arm to press the
finger to her lips and I realized she was looking at something there. The
stoned smile was gone and then her eyes looked up at mine and then she
looked back at the arm. The mellow, exhausted mood in the room reversed
itself and something got activated—everything was humming. Susan began
shaking as she looked up at me again. Before I could stop her she reached
over and pulled the sleeve farther down. She didn’t say anything at first but I
realized that Susan was looking at a deep wound on my forearm surrounded
by purple-and-yellow bruising.
Susan thought she was looking at a bite mark. She said this out loud.
Susan thought this bite mark was in exactly the same place where Susan
had bitten the intruder on Saturday night.
Susan thought the indentations of her teeth were plainly visible.
She just stared at me. She didn’t say anything else. She started crying.
And then she threw up on the front of her robe.
“What’s wrong?” I asked softly.
She was pulling away but I was clutching her bandaged hand.
“Susan, what’s wrong?” I asked again.
She turned away from me, trembling. She was slowly shaking her head
back and forth like a little girl, her chin coated with drool and vomit.
“Please, Susan,” I said softly. “Don’t worry. He’s gone. Robert’s gone.
He can’t hurt you anymore.”
Susan turned back to me, trembling violently now. I was gripping her
hand so tightly she couldn’t pull away.
“Is my secret safe with you?” I asked softly. “Is my secret safe with
you?” I whispered again.
I was squeezing her hand with such force that I could feel it begin to
snap apart—I kept crushing it while telling her in a soothing voice, “He’s
gone, Robert’s gone, it’s all going to be okay, you’re safe,” until I heard
something in her hand breaking. She fainted and slid off the bed. I sat very
still, composing myself, and then slowly stood up, paused, and ran out of the
bedroom and called out to Gayle that Susan said she felt weird and that she
had told me she’d taken too many painkillers and then she threw up and
passed out and fell and I think maybe she broke something in her hand. Gayle
hurried up the stairs and I followed her into Susan’s room, where we both
helped lift her onto the bed. But the bed was wet with urine and so I lifted
Susan back up and placed her in another room as Gayle stripped the sheets
and then called a doctor.
—
I ASSUMED SUSAN NEVER told anybody about what she thought she saw
and I never talked to her again. Susan Reynolds didn’t return to Buckley—
she finished out her senior year at Marymount, where she graduated in June. I
never saw her after that scene in her bedroom until she was standing under an
umbrella at the valet in front of the Palihouse Hotel on that December
afternoon almost forty years later. And it was almost twenty years later when
I found out that Susan actually had told someone about what she thought
she’d seen in her bedroom on Friday the 13th of November, 1981.
—
IT WAS MONDAY of the following week when I went back to school and
became the object of fascination, briefly kind of a hero, because there was no
one else to talk with about what had happened: Susan Reynolds and Thom
Wright weren’t coming back to Buckley their senior year and I had
vanquished Robert Mallory—there were rumors still swirling around him—
and I was the boy who fought off a supposed serial killer and I seemed
dangerous and tough and people wanted to talk to me: I was seen in a new
light, I had an aura of celebrity. I was the center of attention in a way I’d
never been before, now that Thom and Robert and Susan were gone and
Debbie Schaffer wasn’t returning until December. So I told my audience,
whoever it was in those first days back, about what I heard had happened on
Canon Drive on that Saturday night and what had physically happened to
both Susan and Thom, how they’d both been attacked and mangled by a
butcher knife Robert Mallory was wielding—Susan across the chest, and
Thom’s leg sawed open—and that once Robert fled the house Susan
stumbled out onto Canon Drive “covered in blood” and “screaming for help,”
and Robert’s Porsche suddenly and suspiciously appeared and he rushed
them to Cedars-Sinai, pretending that he hadn’t been in the house when he
was in fact the intruder who stabbed them.
And then I told the version of what happened in the Century Towers I’d
already told everyone else. My classmates listened, rapt with horror at my
description of the attack, and they would gasp and dramatically turn when I
unbuttoned my shirt midway and showed off the stitches that crisscrossed my
chest and went down to my rib cage. We had all been attacked by the
Trawler, I told them. The Trawler was Robert Mallory, I told them. And
when he had been found out, he leapt to his death but not before he tried to
kill me. Ryan Vaughn was the only person who had no interest in my story—
he listened once, at lunch, and during it, he stood up, collected his things and
walked to another table, as if he was too unnerved. But this didn’t deter me.
Emboldened by the reaction I was receiving, I continued with the story—the
stabbings, the jump to the balcony below, the struggle, the blood that was
splattered everywhere—and I prolonged it, teasing the incident out, stopping
myself in order to supposedly regain my composure. And afterward people
were so grateful that I was okay. They were so relieved that I had “survived”
the experience. I was congratulated. I was thanked. Everywhere I walked
students from all grades would stare at me and they’d whisper that I was the
boy who had killed the Trawler—everyone knew who he was now and what
he had been capable of. He had actually gone to school with them and Robert
wasn’t there anymore. We were saved because of me.
But something happened that stopped this narrative from continuing.
—
ANOTHER GIRL WAS ABDUCTED, who turned out to be the Trawler’s
final victim in Los Angeles County: a seventeen-year-old named Leslie
Slavin vanished on a crowded Saturday night in Westwood—November 21—
after leaving a group of friends at Yesterdays and walking to her car, which
had been parked in a garage on Glendon Avenue, and then a few random
home invasions started again, but less violent than the one the Trawler had
supposedly committed at the Reynolds residence on North Canon Drive, it
was noted, and he ended up denying that was him—he tacitly acknowledged
the other home invasions but not the one in Beverly Hills. A letter from the
Trawler sent to the Los Angeles Times and verified by the LAPD confirmed
this and referenced Robert Mallory not by name but just as “the God” who
another gift was left to in the house that “the God” occasionally inhabited on
Benedict Canyon. The gift was a sacrifice and the sacrifice was Audrey
Barbour, as all the other girls had been, starting with Katherine Latchford,
and the letter absolved “the God” of any “wrongdoing” or “suspicion.” In fact
the Trawler seemed offended that people briefly thought “the God” had
anything to do with his crimes, his projects, this new girl being the last of
them, the Trawler promised—the one that would be offered to the deceased
boy that the Trawler called “the God.” The Trawler wanted the credit for
Audrey Barbour and the others and resented the fact that people may have
thought Robert was somehow responsible. The letter confirmed that the
Trawler and “his friends” had themselves soundproofed the basement of the
abandoned house on Benedict Canyon, which “the God” sometimes visited,
and that “the sacrifice” had been there for days before being killed and then
discovered on that Sunday night. I realized sickeningly while reading the
article that Audrey Barbour’s body may have been there the day I wandered
through the house and into the basement.
The Trawler also wrote that he had become “intimate” with many of “the
acquaintances” of “the God,” and his friends had too, and “enjoyed” their
“time with them,” though he didn’t name anyone. He mentioned “gifts” he
had left for “the God’s classmates”—mementos, photos, the posters.
—
AND THEN ABIGAIL Mallory released the letters—the fan notes—that had
been sent to Robert beginning in the summer of 1980, after Katherine
Latchford had disappeared, and through the early fall of 1981 and he was
suddenly exonerated—they were obviously from the same voice. It was the
Trawler.
The letters had no specific references to any of the victims—they were
just love letters to “the God” reminding him that the Trawler and his friends
were always watching “the God” and that they were leaving “gifts” and
“sacrifices” for him all over the city and he would find out about them very
soon—“treasures,” the Trawler called them. There was never enough in the
letters for Robert to piece anything together by the time Audrey Barbour had
disappeared. No names of victims, no references to home invasions—just a
constant stalking, telling Robert he’d been “spotted” various places, and that
“the God” was being “watched over.” Robert had not been paying attention to
the narrative beyond the letters as closely as I’d assumed—he didn’t make
the connection between the crimes and the letters. In fact he thought at one
point, according to Abigail, that the letters were coming from a group of
“psycho chicks” or maybe from a girl he’d dated and then abandoned those
first months in California. The realization, swift and brutal, was that there had
been people stalking Robert for almost a year and a half, as well as the
students closest to him once he arrived at Buckley: these followers were the
Trawler and his supposed friends.
Abigail Mallory once again publicly disputed what she believed had
happened between her nephew and Bret Ellis in her condo on the night of
November 7. But she hadn’t been there. And my account was forceful and
dramatic enough so that it became the core truth on which the rest of the
remaining narrative was carried: Robert may not have been the Trawler but
he was a dangerous and suicidal figure who wanted to harm a student that
had been suspicious of him. But this narrative wasn’t enough to save me.
—
I QUICKLY BECAME A PARIAH in ways that I didn’t notice at first after
the Trawler abducted Leslie Slavin and took credit for the death of Audrey
Barbour and it was clearly apparent that Robert Mallory hadn’t killed anyone,
as I had so insisted, but was in fact a victim of the Trawler’s mind games and
his overall obsession with Robert.
I realized the mood about me had shifted fast but it was subtle when it
started—it came in what I thought were only imagined evasions, people
forgetting to say hi or acknowledge me as I walked the pathways under the
eaves, teachers glancing away as I passed them, pretending to be in
conversation with one another, and certain students avoiding me as I pulled
books out of my locker between classes. I found myself standing alone in the
courtyard during assembly. No one was waiting for me in the senior parking
lot or under the bell tower when I arrived there before school started—not
anymore. I noticed I wasn’t being invited out to lunch on the days when the
people I’d thought were my friends headed to Teru Sushi or Du-par’s in
Studio City, or the McDonald’s or Hamburger Hamlet in Sherman Oaks, and
I often found myself eating alone at one of the far tables below the shadow of
the Pavilion, away from the center table, where I used to sit, now occupied by
Ryan Vaughn and Jeff Taylor and Tracy Goldman and Michelle Stevenson,
who Ryan had started dating.
When Debbie Schaffer failed to invite me to Jeff Taylor’s eighteenthbirthday party she was throwing at the house on Stone Canyon I understood
why—we rarely talked the rest of our senior year and I never spoke to Terry
or Liz again. But the exclusion was more painfully clear when a group of
guys including Jeff, Kyle Colson, Anthony Matthews and Dominic
Thompson made plans to see a movie in Westwood and I hadn’t been invited;
this was when I realized I was going to exist on a solitary plane the rest of my
senior year—a loner, an outsider, the person I always knew I was. The
tangible participant simply walked away and muttered adios, hasta luego,
maricón. Whatever status I had once enjoyed completely disappeared. And
maybe if I hadn’t been so close with Thom and Susan for all those years this
was how it would have always been anyway and I was just realizing that
without their presence in close proximity to mine I might have been as
invisible then as I was becoming now. Everything faded from me.
Thom Wright attended the Harvard School for Boys during the
remainder of twelfth grade and I didn’t see him again for almost twenty
years.

IN DECEMBER I received a manila envelope addressed to me only by my
name scrawled across it, BRETT misspelled with two “t”s.
It was sealed and lying on top of the island in the kitchen along with the
rest of the mail and various magazines when I returned home from school on
an overcast Thursday afternoon before Christmas break began. I slowly
walked the hallway to my bedroom, where I closed and locked the door and
sat on the bed before opening the envelope. I pulled out a series of photos,
there were maybe forty of them, eight-by-tens in black and white and many
of them taken with a telephoto lens: the first five were of me at the top of the
bleachers on Gilley Field, alone, and then with Robert Mallory—whoever
was taking the photos must have been somewhere in the forested hills below
Beverly Glen on that day in October when Robert revealed his suspicions
about me and Matt Kellner.
And then there were a series of photos taken across the street from the
house on Benedict Canyon. I was wearing my school uniform and standing
next to my mother’s Jaguar parked on the curving stone driveway and I was
looking up at the house. In another photo I tried turning the handle on the
front door. In another I walked around the side of the house. There were
another series of photos: me pushing open the wrought-iron gate. There was a
photo of me stepping out of the 450SL this time. There was a shot of me
opening the side door of the house and slipping in. There was also a photo I
didn’t recognize at first because it seemed as if it was taken in another era so
far away that I couldn’t place where I was. But then I realized: it was Haskell
Avenue and I was leaving Matt in the pool house, the last time I ever talked
to him, my face was a grimace and clenched with tears, or maybe it could
have been construed as anger. I realized—it had been taken from the back of
a van parked down the street.
And there were five photos that had nobody in them: an empty living
room, a large bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom, the view from behind a sliding
glass door of a swimming pool and a backyard: a tiled fountain, a ficus tree. I
didn’t understand where this location was until I realized they were taken
within my aunt’s house in Palm Springs on South Toledo Avenue.
And then there were five more photos, all taken from inside the house on
Mulholland: the garage without the 450SL in it, an empty living room, my
bathroom, my bedroom, the comforter where the Maxell tape and Matt’s
jockey shorts were laid out.
When I arrived at the last series of photos I saw that they were clear, in
medium and close-up shots—they weren’t taken with a telephoto lens—and
they were of Matt Kellner in a windbreaker standing on a bluff above the
Pacific as the sky darkened behind him and he was staring into the lens
blankly, his mouth partly open, a backpack slung over his shoulder, and
someone had drawn a pentagram in black marker onto the glossy mat of the
photo. There was another photo of Matt standing in a deserted parking lot,
looking lost, staring into the lens of the camera, and he wasn’t frightened.
Another one of him: looking away and half-smiling at someone out of the
photo’s reach. This was, I realized, at Crystal Cove before night fell and the
bonfire was built. I was numb, gazing at his beautiful face, how innocent he
seemed, his full lips and the tousled sun-streaked hair. And then I noticed it:
behind Matt, over his right shoulder, plainly visible, was the beige-colored
van, parked off to the side, almost blending into the whiteness of the sand and
sky, its door opened all the way, positioned so that you couldn’t see a license
plate in the photo.
Scrawled above Matt was the word shhhhh.
I realized there was one more photo at the bottom of the stack and I
placed it over the photo of Matt in the parking lot at Crystal Cove. It was a
photo of Shingy, a medium shot, staring at whoever was taking the picture, in
an empty room somewhere adorned with nothing, bare white walls, only a
cardboard box behind the dog. He wasn’t wearing his collar and he had been
completely shorn of all his hair beneath the neck, as if he was being prepared
for something. A pentagram hovered above his cocked head drawn in red felt
marker. There was something wrong in the photo and then I realized what it
was when I looked more closely at it: one of his eyes was missing and
someone had cut off his tail.

BESIDES MATT AND ROBERT, the other casualty took place in January. It
was simple and there was no mystery involved—it was an accident, bad luck,
fate, nothing to do with Robert Mallory or the Trawler.
Anthony Matthews and Doug Furth were convoying on Pacific Coast
Highway, heading to Jeff Taylor’s father’s place in Malibu. It was the last
weekend of Christmas vacation and they’d met in Westwood to see Taps at
the Avco Center and afterward drive to the Colony to spend the night—it was
a Saturday and the movie started at four o’clock. They took separate cars and
by the time they were on the I-10 it was almost seven—and because it was
raining there was very little traffic as they neared Point Dume. Anthony was
driving his Camaro and Doug was trailing him in his BMW. Anthony was
speeding, according to Doug, but it didn’t appear dangerously so, and neither
one of them was high. It happened simply, in a matter of seconds—Doug said
what happened seemed so far away he couldn’t understand why the Camaro’s
taillights had only “pulled over” to the side of the road in the rainy darkness.
Doug drove closer until the BMW’s headlights illuminated the wreckage
of the Camaro. The car had skidded off the highway and slammed into the
cliff side—simple, a human error, miscalculation, free of meaning or
mystery. Doug pulled his car over and walked carefully toward the Camaro,
shouting Anthony’s name: steam was billowing out from under the crushed
hood and the engine kept making an awful rapid clunking sound that abruptly
stopped and Doug didn’t understand at first what had been flung through the
windshield: but it was Anthony. And he was already dying, stretched across
the crumpled hood, completely jeweled with glass that was slowly turning
purple in the glare of the headlights, and Doug could actually hear the glass
crackling from the warm blood that was quickly streaming out of the spaces
on Anthony’s broken body.

I WAS LUCKY. I was a Pisces. I was the sign of two fish swimming in
opposite directions—a dreamer, moving ceaselessly upstream, not entirely
rational, prone to notions, but blindly pursuing whatever I wanted, a
romantic, an individualist who needed no part of the crowd. My trajectory
was simple: Bennington, reinventing myself, the publication of Less Than
Zero when I was twenty-one, its success and the celebrity that followed,
moving to Manhattan, where other novels were written by this young and
infamous fish in the deep span of empire, a role I played until I didn’t want to
any longer but found myself trapped in regardless. There were the usual soap
operas: various failed relationships, cocaine and Klonopin, I threw so many
parties, the doomed boyfriend who died at thirty of an aortic aneurism, which
was the catalyst for me to finally move back to Los Angeles after being gone
for almost twenty-five years. One scene that still haunts me from those
decades when I lived away from Los Angeles and was trying to forget that
awful fall of 1981 happened in Boston in January of 1999, at the beginnings
of what turned out to be a fifteen-month world book tour for my fifth work of
fiction, Glamorama. I was in college when Less Than Zero was published so
I didn’t have to do one—I had an excuse—and by the time my second book
was released I had amassed enough of a say to dissuade my publisher from a
book tour; no one wanted me to tour for my third novel, the notorious
American Psycho, and I only hit a few cities for a collection of stories in
1994 called The Informers—a couple of boutique bookstores, nothing more. I
had never wanted to participate in a book tour because I’d feel too exposed.
The Trawler had never been captured.
However, too much money had been invested in the new novel for me
not to participate in an endless publicity tour and I wasn’t happy about what
the next year was shaping into. In Boston, on the first leg of the North
American tour, I read for about twenty minutes to a packed audience at
Boston College and then answered questions and afterward was led to a book
signing that would last about two to three hours—this was determined by the
size of the line that snaked through the lobby of the auditorium.
At one point a surprisingly handsome man who was probably around
thirty-five, my age, handed me a hardcover copy of Less Than Zero in
pristine condition, a novel that was almost fifteen years old, a novel that had
nothing and yet everything to do with what happened to me in the fall of
1981. I was signing books, flanked by two PR girls from my publishing
house, and we were working as a team to get all the books signed. They were
there to help move the line along quickly—one would open the books and
slide them to me, I’d sign them, then slide the books to the girl on my other
side, and we’d keep the line moving. I briefly glanced up at the handsome
man and smiled, because I wanted to make eye contact with whoever was in
line to get a book signed, and I did a double take because he seemed so
familiar. He was wearing a suit, Brooks Brothers, and a tie and a long camelhair coat and he was holding an umbrella, his hair short and lightly graying at
the sides, and his face was smooth-shaven and classically boyish. He just
stared at me and I felt frightened, and then lustful, and then confused. He had
the body of an athlete: trim, with slightly broad shoulders, but also compact,
a runner, muscular and lithe. I didn’t say anything. And the man didn’t say
anything either. When I glanced up at him again he just stared at me with a
slightly wary smile. He seemed reticent, conservative, probably a
businessman, a professional, a banker. He was so familiar—someone from
my faraway past, a person I hadn’t seen in years. I looked up at him
helplessly. Everything froze.
“It’s for Thom,” he said. “Spelled with an ‘h.’ ”
I pretended at first not to know who this was but it was Thom Wright,
who I had not seen or spoken to since 1981. It immediately became awkward.
He was waiting for my recognition.
And after I signed his full name without his asking me to he looked up
from the title page and smiled.
“If you wait,” I said, staring up at his face, “we can talk.” I paused.
“After this.”
He checked his Rolex. He briefly thought about something. And then he
nodded.
—
IT WAS SNOWING that day in Boston and I found Thom standing outside,
in front of the lobby of the auditorium where the book signing had taken
place. A black sedan was waiting for me at the curb—I was being driven to a
TV station for a live interview promoting tomorrow’s in-store signing,
wherever that was. I told Sloane and Karen that I needed to talk to an old
friend. One of them reminded me we had to be at the station in thirty minutes
and there was traffic. The snow was lightly drifting toward us as we stood in
the overhang and made small talk about how Thom had been following my
career since 1985, our breath steaming in the ice-cold air, and it was getting
dark out.
“I don’t know what to say,” I finally said. “I can’t believe you’re here.”
“I wasn’t going to come,” Thom said. “But I couldn’t help it.”
“Why haven’t we seen each other in twenty years?” I asked. “What
happened, Thom?” I just stared at him. “I thought of you so many times…”
Thom stared back at me, deciding something. His face flickered with a
thought, and then became darkly animated. I noticed he suddenly seemed
troubled. There was doubt.
“She called me in the hospital after she saw you,” he said. “Susan.”
I nodded and kept staring at him.
“She sounded high, desperate.” Thom stopped. “She said she saw
something on your arm.”
“I know,” I said.
“She wanted us to call the police,” Thom said. “She thought…” He
didn’t know how to say this without being ashamed, and then he did: “…that
you had done it.”
Thom breathed in, exhaled. I needed a cigarette but for some reason
didn’t want to smoke in front of Thom and refrained from reaching for the
pack of Marlboros in the pocket of my Armani overcoat. All my boyish
desires about him had returned with a feeling that was tidal. He resumed
talking but hesitantly, unsure of himself. “I told her she was…crazy and that I
would deny it. That this sounded insane. Totally insane…” He stopped,
distracted by the two women waiting by the black sedan—their stances
suggested I needed to hurry. Thom sighed, breath steaming from his mouth.
“But it also…scared me. She seemed…so positive…it was you. And I told
her she was crazy and that I wasn’t going along with this crazy shit and that
she should just stop it.” He paused. “I told her she’d hurt me enough, leave
me alone, I don’t want any part of it. I don’t know.” Thom paused again. “I
didn’t really want to see you or really anybody after what happened to me…”
The slightly quizzical expression flattened out into blankness. “But…it
wasn’t you, right?” It had been years he’d been waiting to ask me this. I
breathed in, and shook my head no.
“Thom,” I said. “It wasn’t me.” I looked away from him and at the snow
drifting over the sedan and the two women standing next to it as the sky got
darker—the sky was turning black—and then I was looking at Thom. “She
was so high that day on painkillers when I saw her…” I stopped. “When she
thought she saw…the thing on my arm…”
Thom just stared at me. “Who was it, then?” he asked quietly.
Again, there was doubt—it was slight but it hovered everywhere. The
wind kept the snow drifting toward us beneath the overhang. I noticed how it
dusted Thom’s shoes.
I shrugged. I paused. “Maybe it was the Trawler…I don’t know…”
Thom stared at me until he nodded. He remained blank-faced.
“They never found out who that was,” Thom said. “Did they.” It wasn’t a
question. He knew the answer. “The Trawler.”
I slowly shook my head. “No, they didn’t.” I glanced over at the two
girls. One of them tapped her wrist with a finger, indicating it was time to
finish up.
“I guess she was traumatized and saw…things everywhere for a while,
signs and signals, and she became paranoid…Everything was an…omen, a
reminder,” Thom said. He had glanced over at the sedan as well and realized
time was running out. “But we never got back together. So. It didn’t really
matter to me what her state of mind was.”
“Thom,” I said. “I’m…sorry.”
He seemed surprised. “For what?” he asked. “What do you have to be
sorry for?”
“For not reaching out to you,” I said. “For all those years of not reaching
out to you.” I paused, and then said it, “Explaining how I felt about you.”
He considered this, looked away, and squinted at the snow blanketing the
sidewalk. I had confirmed something that he didn’t want to hear. “Well, for a
long time I wasn’t reachable,” is all Thom said, offering a tight smile.
I asked Thom if he wanted to meet for dinner later that night, back at my
hotel, I was staying at the Ritz-Carlton. Thom politely backed off and said
that he had plans but that it was good to see me, however briefly, and thanked
me for signing his book. I gave him my number in New York but he didn’t
call and I never saw him again.
I BEGAN THIS version of the book last spring: something cracked and it
came easily in ways it never had before. The facts from that fall were
receding from memory but being seventeen actually became clearer to me
emotionally, more focused and pressing than it ever had at fifty-six, and I
realized I had needed this distance of forty years to finally begin writing the
book. And it was no longer a story about its most dramatic and eerie element
—the mystery of the Trawler and his victims and our interaction with him—
but it was about Matt Kellner, who began haunting my dreams, his presence
trailing me throughout my days, holding on to my hand as I walked through
the aisle of a supermarket or sitting in the passenger seat of my car as I drove
aimlessly through the empty city or lying next to me in bed as I streamed a
movie late at night. There were weeks that spring when he was the only
person I ever thought about and I remembered the way he smelled, chlorine
and suntan lotion and semen, and the salted way he tasted, how beautiful he
was—and my days would get altered. The book was no longer, as it had been
when I tried writing it in 1983 and 1999 and 2006 and 2013, only about the
lead-up to the awful attacks we survived on November 7, but about the
complicated reserves of desire I had for Susan Reynolds and her numbness—
which became the guiding aesthetic in my work, which I adopted from her:
she was, in many ways, my inspiration. It also surprised me that I found
myself writing about my love for Thom Wright, which had been ignited at
that moment when I glimpsed his naked body in the locker room after a
summer away, lust igniting the flow of memory, when I came to the crushing
conclusion I’ve yet to meet a man I wanted to live with for the rest of my life
as much as I did with Thom Wright. Forty years passed and I never found
one because, at a certain point, I realized such men simply didn’t exist or at
least not in the ways I wanted—in so many aspects I’d remained a child.
Another reason I started writing the book had to do with Debbie Schaffer,
who I realized was more complex as I laid the story out—I thought she would
end up simply entitled, a princess, but when I remembered the specifics of the
narrative this didn’t turn out to be true. I had almost reached out to Debbie
when I heard Terry had killed himself in the summer of 1992—my father had
died a month earlier—but I knew she wouldn’t have wanted to talk to me.
I’ve always had a hard time finding peace with that. Nothing was resolved.
—
THE BOOK DETAILED more than I thought it would about Ryan Vaughn
and I comforted myself with the notion that we were simply too young and
born in the wrong time and though we should have been allowed to be
ourselves there was no way this was going to happen in 1981. And since then
I had often wondered if we could have made it work together after we left
Buckley: in New York, in Vermont, in San Francisco, which is where Ryan
Vaughn eventually moved. He barely spoke to me the rest of our senior year,
and once, at graduation in June of 1982, we bumped into each other
accidentally in the boys’ bathroom in the Pavilion after the ceremony, both of
us draped in red robes and still wearing the mortarboard caps: there was a
surprised silence that I broke by saying “Ryan—” and then he interrupted
with “See ya!,” making the What’s up? face we used to share. Ryan had no
social-media presence—I realized this when I tried to find him in 2013, as I
dreamt about another version of this book—and I had no idea what actually
happened to him until I was at a cocktail party at the Sunset Tower in 2018,
where I ran into Tracy Goldman, who I hadn’t seen since graduation, and we
started talking about our long-ago classmates, since we had nothing else in
common, and when I asked her if she knew anything about Ryan Vaughn she
told me that she heard, though she couldn’t exactly remember where, he was
an architect in San Francisco and living with his partner—it was obvious
what she meant with that word and the way she lightly pressed down on it,
expecting me to be as surprised as she was where Ryan Vaughn had ended
up. I don’t know why this wounded me to the extent that it did—it had been
almost forty years since we’d kissed—but I left the party immediately after
that conversation and drove the streets of the city as I used to on nights when
I was sad and seventeen in the fall of 1981.
—
DESPITE MY FAMILIARITY with the events, the book frightened me, as
love does, as dreams do, and almost drove my partner mad when he read the
things I was revealing to this new friend who had moved into our house and
who I now spent time with daily in my office. Todd and I would have fights
in which he disputed the “veracity” of certain events that I adamantly
confirmed, and as the writing of the book carried me to the ending, it filled
him with such palpable fear that being near me became almost unbearable.
And he would leave the condo on Doheny for days at a time while I wrote in
my office, and scanned old journals filled with lists, the school yearbook
Images opened to a certain page, notes littered with song titles everywhere.
Some nights Todd slept in motels he could afford on the darker side of
Hollywood and I drank more than usual—after I moved through a particular
chapter or sequence of events I found myself wiped out and immediately
reached for the bottle of Tanqueray in the kitchen cabinet and simply drank
the gin quickly in a glass with some ice. If that failed to move me away from
the chill I’d take a Xanax or an Ativan that our dealer supplied us with and
then, lightly stoned, I would end up back in my office, listening to the music
from that period on YouTube, almost every night while I was writing the
book, sometimes three or four hours in a row, the songs that summed up that
period, anthems about hope for the future, the new metamorphosis, leaving
childhood behind: Vienna, Nowhere Girl, Icehouse, Time For Me To Fly. But
many of the songs now sounded like desperate desire and rejection and
running away. If the songs were about, as I once thought, a child who became
a man, they were also, for me at fifty-six, about a man who stayed a child.
—
A WEEK AGO I saw a beige-colored van parked at the 7-Eleven on
Holloway and La Cienega, next door to the Palihouse Hotel, where I first
glimpsed Susan Reynolds after not seeing her for thirty-eight years, and
whenever I see a similar van I connect it with the Trawler and his obsession
over Robert Mallory and the fact that he was never captured—he had drifted
to other states perhaps, beginning new narratives, staking out a different
story, and sometimes I dream about Robert and in the dreams he’s a different
person that I meet up with in a vast hotel or an empty airplane, sometimes
disguised as someone else, sometimes older, but mostly young, and staring at
me fixed in that moment of his teenage beauty, a place where he would
always reside—he would never age. And sometimes when I wake up from
one of my dreams about Robert, or Matt, or Ryan Vaughn, or Thom, or
Susan, I’m reminded that the fall of 1981 wasn’t the dream that I sometimes
pretended it was in the decades that followed. But I always slipped whenever
I heard those faraway voices calling out to me, and I would find that record
with the platinum-blonde girl on the cover, and turn the volume up, and play
it loud, close my eyes and lie back and listen to a song about dreaming.
